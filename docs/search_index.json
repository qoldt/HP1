Newman February 2019 Part 1 Introduction 1.1 Epigenetics While typically seen as a recent field of study, Epigenetics, or at least a broader form of it, was conceptualized in the classical era by perhaps the earliest embryologist, Aristotle (384-322 BCE). In his Generation of Animals (Aristotle and Peck 1943), Aristotle contrasts his observations of developing chick embryos against the theory of preformation, which stated the progeny of animals was derived from very tiny ‘pre-formed’ versions of the complete organism. Upon observing the gradual transformations that occur during the development of the chick embryo, Aristotle posited a theory of ‘epigenesis’ (above the source) which stated that an organism gradually develops from an undifferentiated material. The word ‘epigenesis’ re-emerged in the english language in the early 17th century (Harvey 1653), where its meaning was defined by oxford as ‘partium super-exorientium additamentum’, ‘the additament of parts budding one out of another’ or simply ‘extra-growth’. At the beginning of the 20th century, pre-molecular embryologists were beginning to characterize developmental processes in the wake of Darwin and Lamarck. Several experiments performed at this time led many to the conclusion that the sequence of events that took place from ‘undifferentiated material’ into different tissues, and eventually to a fully functional organism were largely irreversible. From the common usage and its adjective epigenetic, Conrad Hal Waddington (1905-1975) coined the term epigenetics to collectively refer to these processes. Waddington ascribed an “epigenetic landscape” (Waddington 1940) metaphor to developmental processes, where a marble at the top of a hill (undifferentiated cell) could freely roll downhill into one of many valleys (specific differentiation pathway). Once downhill, the marble could not spontaneously change valleys (transdifferentiate), as it is fate-committed. This popular metaphor remains relevant to this day. Most modern cellular reprogramming requires that you push the marble back up the hill (at least partway), before re-selecting your appropriate valley, although there are emerging cases where direct reprogramming is possible. Figure 1.1: Conrad H. Waddington’s Epigenetic Landscape (Organisers and Genes, 1940) Given its scope, in that the contemporary study of epigenetics ranges from developmental processes, to imprinted parent-of-origin effects, to transgenerational effects originating from parental stressors, a meeting at Cold Spring Harbor in 2008 formulated the consensus definition of epigenetics to be: “[a] stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence”. Here, ‘stably heritable’ is implied to be either through mitosis or meiosis. However, as we will see, changes can occur to the epigenome in fully differentiated somatic cells, which can often affect their function. While such changes are not directly heritable, they are not considered to be any less epigenetic. While an organism’s genome confers cellular identity through the combinatorial expression of a unique set of genes, it is the superimposed epigenome that maintains the integrity of said identity. To return to Waddington’s Epigenetic Landscape, the physical deposition of chemical modifications to histones and DNA in the creation of heterochromatin generates hills and barriers to not only facilitate cellular differentiation, but to restrict later de-differentiation. The perturbation of this ‘epigenetic integrity’, which ensures cell-type specific gene transcription and splicing, can result in altered cellular states that lead to altered protein synthesis (Feinberg 2018) and reduced cellular metabolism (Ferrari et al. 2018), loss of identity (Cheloufi and Hochedlinger 2017; Cheloufi et al. 2015), cell death (Karlic et al. 2014), and even cancer (Campbell and Wellen 2018; Kinnaird et al. 2016). In addition to epigenetic changes that induce strong cellular changes (i.e. those that are directly pathogenic or tumorigenic), a growing body of evidence points to a ‘heterochromatin loss’ or ‘epigenetic drift’ theory of aging - whereby epigenome integrity is slowly compromised, leading to multiple compounding cascades which eventually result in cellular failure. While epigenome integrity is no doubt important in all cell types, it is especially important to understand how these epigenetic processes are vulnerable in neurons, which are not only non-dividing, but whose high metabolism leaves them highly susceptible to DNA damage. The epigenome is dictated by several different molecular mechanisms such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, histone variants and histone post-translational modifications, non-coding RNAs, and active chromatin remodeling and interactions with the nuclear envelope. Prior to reviewing how these processes change over the course of cellular and neuronal aging, several of these mechanisms will be explored briefly below. DNA Modifications The archetypal epigenetic modification is perhaps the methylation of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides, which has been studied extensively since it was suggested it could impact gene activity long ago (Riggs 1975). In humans, 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC) is found in approximately 1.5% of genomic DNA (Lister et al. 2009). While cytosine methylation can occur in other contexts (such as CA dinucleotides), methylation occurs to 60-80% of CpG dinucleotides in mouse and human (Ehrlich et al. 1982; Gruenbaum et al. 1981). However, CpG dinucleotides that cluster in ‘CpG islands’ at promoter regions and gene bodies, generally remain unmethylated (Bird 1986). Methylation at CpG islands can serve as a direct mode of epigenetic control, as the DNA- binding activity of most transcription factors is sensitive to CpG methylation (Fiore et al. 1999; Hark et al. 2000; Mancini et al. 1999; Prendergast and Ziff 1991; Tate and Bird 1993). That said, it should be noted that evidence suggests that the DNA demethylation important for normal development occurs in areas that are not CpG islands (Jones 2012), and we should wary of oversimplification with regards to CpG island annotations. Cytosine methylation in DNA is established and maintained by the family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) of which there are five known members: Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Dnmt3c, and Dnmt3L. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b encode two closely related de novo methyl transferases and are responsible for generating DNA methylation patterns during gametogenesis and in early embryonic development (Kaneda et al. 2004; Okano et al. 1999) where Dnmt3a specifically mediates the methylation of imprinted genes in germ cells (Barau et al. 2016). Dnmt3L lacks the catalytic domain but is still important for establishing imprinting control regions (ICRs) in gametes in addition to stimulating Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b activity (Bourc’his et al. 2001; Hata et al. 2002; Xie et al. 2006). Dnmt3c has only recently been identified, arising from a duplication of Dnmt3b, and described to be important in male germ cells (Jain et al. 2017). Dnmt1 is set apart in that it is the maintenance methyltransferase, responsible for depositing methylation after DNA replication (Bestor et al. 1988; Chuang et al. 1997) in addition to restoring DNA methylation following DNA repair (Mortusewicz et al. 2005). DNA can be passively or actively demethylated. Until recently it was believed the only form of DNA demethylation was the passive loss of DNA methylation due to improper maintenance methylation by Dnmt1. However it is now understood that active demethylation can occur by at least three different pathways. The first involves deamination and base exchange by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) which occurs (somewhat paradoxically) in the presence of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (M’etivier et al. 2008). The second involves induction of the nuclear excision repair system by Gadd45 (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 45) (Barreto et al. 2007). The third pathway to demethylate cytosines involves enzymes that oxidize 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxy-methyl-cytosine (5hmC) (Tahiliani et al. 2009), which is a process now understood to be of great importance in both the development and proper functioning of the central nervous system (Guo et al. 2011; Hahn et al. 2013; Mell’en et al. 2012). Once converted, 5hmC may be dealkylated resulting in a normal cytosine (Guo et al. 2011). The enzymes that actively convert 5mC to 5hmC are called Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) enzymes, of which there are three members: TET1, TET2, and TET3. In addition to converting 5mC to 5hmC as an intermediate, Tet enzymes can further oxidize 5hmC residues to 5-formyl-cytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxyl-cytosine (5caC), which can be reverted to an unmodified cytosine by Base Exchange Repair (BER) (Ito et al. 2011; Maiti and Drohat 2011). Chromatin DNA in eukaryotic cells is organized by histone and non-histone proteins, which is collectively known as chromatin. Here, the fundamental unit is the nucleosome, where 146 bp of DNA wraps around a single octamer of histones (Luger et al. 1997). The composition of the histone octamer, post-translational modifications to its subunits, and non-histone proteins define higher order structures and DNA accessibility. Based on both structural conformation and gene transcription, Chromatin is broadly categorized into two major compartments; transcriptionally active euchromatin, and transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Euchromatin, being the transcriptionally active compartment of the nucleus, corresponds with histone modifications that facilitate open DNA-histone conformations and access to the DNA. These may involve methylation, in the case of H3K4me1 (read as histone 3 lysine 4 mono-methylation) at promoters and enhancers, or H3K4me3 (histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation) at transcription start sites (Santos-Rosa et al. 2002). Specific histone acetylation also favors open conformations, such as H3K9ac (histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation) and H3K18ac on promoters and H3K27ac more often seen on enhancers (Jin et al. 2011). Methylation of H3K36me3 is often seen on gene bodies and was recently shown to play a prominent role in exon inclusion and splicing (Edmunds, Mahadevan, and Clayton 2008; Hu et al. 2010; Kolasinska-Zwierz et al. 2009). While DNA methylation is more common in heterochromatin, DNA methylation has also been observed in euchromatin, where it too can affect exon inclusion (Yearim et al. 2015). Transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin can be categorized into either constitutive or facultative. Constitutive Heterochromatin is comprised of peri-centromeric, telomeric and perinucleolar heterochromatin and marked by tightly bound heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (Blasco 2007; Santoro, Li, and Grummt 2002; Wreggett et al. 1994) and histone modifications H3K9me3 (Bannister et al. 2001; Lachner et al. 2001) and H4K20me3 (Kourmouli et al. 2004; Schotta 2004). Constitutive heterochromatin is typically densely packed, inaccessible and DNA hyper-methylated (Blasco 2007; Lubit et al. 1976; Santoro, Li, and Grummt 2002). Facultative Heterochromatin refers to heterochromatinization of non-genic and genic areas that are developmentally regulated. In addition to H3K9me3/HP1/H4K20me3, facultative heterochromatin may contain H3K27me3, an important modification for tight temporal regulation of gene expression (Hahn et al. 2013). While there appears to be some cross-talk between H3K9me3- and H3K27me3- mediated repression (Riclet et al. 2008; Mozzetta et al. 2014), both are largely regulated by different pathways. H3K27me3 is regulated by the polycomb repressive complex PRC1 and PRC2 (Cao and Zhang 2004; Eskeland et al. 2010). H3K9me3 in constitutive heterochromatin is deposited by the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1/H2 (Peters et al. 2001; O’Carroll et al. 2000) while in facultative heterochromatin this is typically mediated by KAP1 (KRAB Associated Protein 1, also known as TRIM28 or TIF1\\(\\beta\\))-mediated recruitment of the methyltransferase SETDB1 (SET Domain Bifurcated 1) (Schultz et al. 2002), which will be discussed later. Chromatin Remodelling The list of proteins and RNAs that bind, read, write, or remodel chromatin is an ever growing one. On the macromolecular scale, large-scale chromatin re-organization can be determined by the combinatorial assembly of a large ATP-dependent Chromatin Remodelling Complex. In this arena subunits that form such assemblies have suffered greatly from classification and nomenclature problems. The most studied classification is the differential assembly of mammalian SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable (mSWI/SNF) or Brg/Brm-associated factor (BAF) complexes (Wang et al. 1996). During neuronal differentiation, BAF subunits found in progenitors are substituted to neuronal subunits, which confer differential specificity to chromatin remodeling (Staahl et al. 2013). Given the estimation that the combinatorial assembly of BAF subunits could yield at least 36 unique complexes, differential composition of this complex could in turn generate a multitude of chromatin architectures in different cell types. Once present, chromatin remodeling complexes may also recruit other structural proteins and chromatin-modifying enzymes such as Histone De-ACetylases (HDACs), Histone Methyl-Transferases (HMTs) and DNA Methyl-Transferases (DNMTs) that ensure the modified chromatin architecture persists. Ultimately however, chromatin remodeling complexes are secondary to the transcription factors or co-factors that recruit them. KRAB-ZFPs, Transposable Elements and Exaptation The largest and oldest family of transcription factors is the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs), which have proved integral to heterochromatinization pathways and gene regulation. KRAB-ZFPs have co-evolved to silence exogenously-derived proviruses and other retrotransposons such as LINEs that at one point integrated into the host germline (Thomas and Schneider 2011; Imbeault, Helleboid, and Trono 2017). While DNA transposons (‘cut and paste’) are thought to be extinct in higher eukaryotes, multiple RNA transposons (or retrotransposons, ‘copy and paste’) are known to be capable of transposition in mammals (Figure 1.2). Retrotransposons can be divided into LTR containing and non-LTR containing. Viruses that successfully integrate into the germline are henceforth termed endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and carry 5’ and 3’ long terminal repeats (LTRs). Over evolutionary time, these foreign sequences accrue mutations and lose their transposition potential, meaning they are no longer a direct threat to genomic instability. However, because the LTRs of many viruses contain the multiple eukaryotic transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) to ensure host-replication, upon integration these ancient ERVs can confer a new layer of transcriptional regulation, a process termed exaptation (Thompson, Macfarlan, and Lorincz 2016; Imbeault, Helleboid, and Trono 2017). Figure 1.2: Sequence architecture of mammalian LTR and non-LTR Retrotransposons. Non-LTR transposons include Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs), Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) Arthrobacter luteus (Alu) and SINE/VNTR/Alu (SVA) elements. LTR-retrotransposons are resultant of past exogenous viral integration into the germline. LTR retrotransposons are comprised of 5’ and 3’ long terminal repeats (LTRs) and retroviral open reading frames ‘gag’, ‘pol’, and a deficient ‘env’. Recombination between 5’ and 3’ LTRs deletes the internal region, leaving behind a solitary LTR which harbors regulatory regions and transcription factor binding sites. Most of the LTRs in the genome, and subsequently also the most frequently exaptated are “solo” LTRs. Such sequences are generated by homologous recombination between repetitive sequences on 5’ and 3’ LTRs of a full length ERV. Over evolutionary time, purifying selection means that an exaptated ERV may lose all identifying ‘viral’ sequences, retaining only the binding sites required for transcriptional regulation (Brady et al. 2009). Indeed, ERVs have been more frequently exaptated compared to other transposable elements, despite comprising only 6-8% of the human genome, they have provided an estimated 25% of functional TFBSs (Chuong et al. 2013; Cordaux and Batzer 2009; Sundaram et al. 2014) although it could be more. Non-LTR transposons such as LINE1 are considerably more ancient. They can be viewed as ‘molecular fossils’ of the first primitive replication systems that transitioned molecular genetics from being RNA-based to DNA-based. Based on the phylogeny of the reverse transcriptase found in LINE1, models suggest that LINE1 elements were once components of mobile introns of eubacteria and were transmitted to eukaryotes during the symbiosis that gave rise the mitochondria (Zimmerly et al. 1995). The subsequent acquisition of an endonuclease enzyme and promoter sequence granted LINE1 autonomy to insert into multiple locations of the genome in addition to providing the machinery to mobilize in trans other non-autonomous retrotransposons such as Alu and SVA (Dewannieux, Esnault, and Heidmann 2003; Hancks and Kazazian 2012; Kajikawa and Okada 2002). In addition to silencing retrotransposons to maintain genetic stability, KRAB-ZFPs coordinate spatio-temporal regulation of exaptated regulatory sequences for transcriptional regulation. The role of KRAB-ZFPs in utilizing transposon-derived sequences for transcriptional regulation in ES cells is well established (Maksakova et al. 2013; Rowe et al. 2013) as well as throughout development (Friedli and Trono 2015), and continues to be elucidated in adult tissues (Ecco et al. 2016). Heterochromatinization and HP1 How KRAB-ZFPs initiate heterochromatinization of an ERV or an exaptated regulatory region involves the building of a large heterochromatin-like complex. First, the KRAB-ZFP recognizes a specific DNA sequence with its zinc fingers. Next, the KRAB domain of the KRAB-ZFP interacts with KAP1, which acts as the central co-factor able to bind HDACs, HMTases, DNMTs, ATRX-DAXX and Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1). ATRX (considered to be a BAF chromatin remodeling component) -mediated recruitment of DAXX is known to replace the H3 histone subunit with H3.3 at constitutive chromatin (Voon and Wong 2016). While H3.3 deposition at pericentric, constitutive and telomeric chromatin is essential for mammalian development (Jang et al. 2015), how it affects H3K9me3 deposition remains unclear (Udugama et al. 2015). Sumoylation of the bromodomain of KAP1 enables binding of both HDAC1/2 and SETDB1 (Ivanov et al. 2007). Histone de-acetylation prepares for tri-methylation at H3K9 by SETDB1, which creates a high-affinity binding site for HP1, aiding in the localization of ATRX-DAXX, Uhrf1 and DNMTs, all of which bind to KAP1 (Ayyanathan 2003; Rottach et al. 2010; Smallwood et al. 2007; Voon and Gibbons 2016; Zuo et al. 2011). While this nucleation event creates a heterochromatin-like domain that is strongly heritable through mitotic divisions (Ayyanathan 2003), it is spatially restricted to a few kilobases. This is often the case at imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs), where ZFP57 recruits the KAP1 complex to maintain methylation during the pre-implantation period in the embryo (Voon and Gibbons 2016). In some cases, this small KAP1-SETDB1-HP1 heterochromatin-like domain may continue to extend further megabases through cyclical deposition and heterochromatin spreading of H3K9me3 by a SUV39H1-HP1 complex (Vogel et al. 2006; Groner et al. 2010), or the heterochromatin-like domain can itself be mobilized to constitutive heterochromatin by HP1 (Cammas et al. 2007), which can bridge H3K9me3 chromatin fibres (Hiragami-Hamada et al. 2016). Notably, HP1 proteins are known to be required for recruitment of other methyltransferases responsible for H4K20me3 (Kourmouli et al. 2005; Kourmouli et al. 2004; Schotta 2004) which induces strong compaction of nucleosomes (Lu et al. 2008) and has distinct implications in cellular senescence (Nelson et al. 2016). Non-Coding RNA Various types of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) have now emerged to be vitally important in directing the epigenetic landscape. Since the classical example of inactivation of the entire X chromosome by the long non-coding RNA Xist (Brown et al. 1992; Wutz 2011), it is now known that ncRNAs work in various ways to profoundly impact gene regulation and genome stability. Non-coding RNAs can affect gene regulation in various ways. In some cases, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can originate from ultraconserved elements and act by directly interfering with polycomb-mediated repression (Fiorenzano et al. 2018). Some ncRNAs have prominent roles in splicing (Ashwal-Fluss et al. 2014; Gonzalez et al. 2015), while others can act as sponges to micro-RNA or RNA-binding proteins (Memczak et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2016). Other ncRNAs act locally in cis to regulate the transcription of their ‘gene neighborhood’ (Joung et al. 2017), an effect that is prominently seen at imprinting control regions (Mancini-DiNardo et al. 2006; Sleutels, Zwart, and Barlow 2002; Williamson et al. 2011). A large body of evidence has shown that ncRNAs derived from different repeat regions are often required for inducing or maintaining epigenetic modifications. Transcription of PAPAS (Promoter and Pre-rRNA AntiSense), an ncRNA that is antisense to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats, is required for rDNA silencing by recruitment of DNMT3b and SUV420H2-mediated deposition of H4K20me3 (Santoro et al. 2010; Santoro, Li, and Grummt 2002; Schmitz et al. 2010; Bierhoff et al. 2014). Similarly, silencing and deposition of H4K20me3 on transposable element sequences such as ERVs and LINEs is RNA dependent (Bierhoff et al. 2014; Slotkin and Martienssen 2007; Yang and Kazazian Jr 2006). In constitutive heterochromatin, RNA derived from major and minor satellite ncRNA have distinct roles in proper centromere specification and function (Wong et al. 2007) and their transcription is required for recruitment of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) and H3K9me3 (Maison et al. 2002). Similarly, transcription of the ncRNA TERRA (telomeric repeat-containing RNA) is intrinsically linked with telomere stability (Nergadze et al. 2009). Finally, non-coding RNAs have garnered much attention over their ability to confer transgenerational changes. In Caoenorhabditis elegans, neuronal double-stranded RNA can induce germline silencing for up to 25 generations (Devanapally, Ravikumar, and Jose 2015). In higher organisms such as the mouse, it has been shown that both stress and exercise can alter small non-coding RNAs in sperm, resulting in augmented anxiety responses in offspring (Rodgers et al. 2013; Rodgers et al. 2015; Short et al. 2017). The above epigenetic mechanisms act in concert and are interdependent in conferring a cell-type specific genomic architecture; where a subset of genes are accessibly transcribed in the euchromatic compartment, and unused genes and regulatory regions are silenced and compacted in facultative chromatin. 1.2 The Heterochromatin Loss Model of Aging Age-related disruption of heterochromatin boundaries greatly modifies the 3D architecture of the nucleus and has profound effects on cellular function. Age-related restructuring of the chromatin landscape can occur in either of two ways. The first is organismal aging, where a gradual reduction in normal physiological function occurs in a time dependent manner and is typically accompanied by heterochromatin loss. Organismal aging increases susceptibility to many diseases such as metabolic disorders, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Kennedy et al. 2014; Moskalev et al. 2014). The second, which can be observed in dividing cells, is cellular (or replicative) senescence. In contrast to the organismal aging, cellular senescence is a specialized process that results in an irreversible cell cycle-arrest now known to be a cellular response to a variety of stresses such as DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and oncogene activation, and is now thought to serve as an anticancer mechanism in response to oncogenic stimuli (Di Leonardo et al. 1994; Lin et al. 1998). Until now both processes are described to be functionally distinct, where heterochromatin loss is common in aging cells, and senescent cells show large senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs). However, recent work suggests that senescence is likely to occur in a two step process, first involving heterochromatin loss followed by SAHF formation (Chandra et al. 2015), suggesting that senescence and organismal aging may proceed by similar routes. Figure 1.3: An Emerging Consensus of the Aging Epigenome. (Modified from Booth and Brunet 2016) The heterochromatin loss model of aging was first put forward by Villeponteau (Villeponteau 1997), who proposed that the heterochromatin domains established in embryogenesis are perturbed during aging, contributing to the aberrant de-repression of silenced genes. In general, age-related decreases of histone de-acetylase components (Pegoraro et al. 2009), the methyltransferase SUV39H1 and bound HP1 have been observed in various species ranging from drosophila to human (Djeghloul et al. 2016; Wood et al. 2010; Jeon et al. 2018; Ryu et al. 2011). Notably, in drosophila, increasing HP1 protein and subsequent heterochromatin formation increases longevity (Larson et al. 2012). Age-related heterochromatin loss resulting in increased transcription of repeats and transposable elements has been observed in several species and human progeria models (Larson et al. 2012; Smeal et al. 1996; Sousa-Victor et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2015; Djeghloul et al. 2016; De Cecco et al. 2013). The findings described in the following section are summarized in Figure 1.3. Until now, most genomic work on humans has been on somatic cells derived from human patients with premature aging syndromes (‘progeria’), which in general are characterized by the loss of heterochromatin (Liu et al. 2011; Miller et al. 2013; Shumaker et al. 2006). Two diseases that mimic premature aging in humans are Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and atypical Werner Syndrome. Individuals with HGPS on average live until 13 years of age, and typically die of artherosclerosis or other cardiac related problems (Pereira et al. 2008). Patients with HGPS express ‘progerin’, a truncated form of the Lamin A receptor, normally important for maintaining heterochromatin domains around the nuclear envelope. Patients with HGPS show reduced levels of SUV39H1, H3K9me3 and HP1 and a corresponding increase in levels of satellite repeat RNA (Shumaker et al. 2006). However, somewhat paradoxically, H4K20me3 is elevated in both growth-arrested cells and HGPS cells (Shumaker et al. 2006), which may be a result of de-repressed lncRNAs which direct its deposition (Bierhoff et al. 2014). By contrast, aged human diploid fibroblasts show a near complete loss of H4K20me3 despite modest increases in H4K20me1 and H4K20me2 (O’Sullivan et al. 2010). A study examining the brains of the SAMP8 mouse model, which displays accelerated senescence, found no discernible difference in H4K20me3 levels in aged animals (Wang et al. 2010). Patients with Werner Syndrome express a mutant from of the WRN gene (Werner syndrome RecQ like helicase), which is also important in DNA replication, transcription, repair and centromeric heterochromatin. WRN deficient cells obtained from patients with Werner syndrome show deficits in DNA repair, loss of SUV39H1, H3K9me3 and HP1, and display accelerated senescence. This phenotype can be partially reversed by maintaining heterochromatin. Overexpression of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) in WRN-deficient mesenchymal stem cells can restore H3K9me3 levels and repress cellular senescence (Zhang et al. 2015). Importantly, Zhang et al (2015) found that cells derived from normal healthy individuals, levels of SUV39H1, H3K9me3 and HP1 decline steadily until very old age, when levels return. This return of new heterochromatin domains is likely coincident with the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), which are a hallmark of senescent cells. SAHFs are composed of large heterochromatin domains enriched in H3K9me3 and HP1 proteins (Narita et al. 2003), but are not as densely packed as healthy constitutive heterochromatin (Chandra et al. 2015). Additionally, it has been observed that H3K27me3, found in facultative heterochromatin, is predominantly lost in C. Elegans and human progeria models (Shah et al. 2013; Ni et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2015). Given partial crosstalk between H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 systems, changes in H3K27me3 distribution may or may not be directly linked to HP1 loss (Jamieson et al. 2015). DNA methylation shows distinct age-related changes so tightly linked with age, that it provides the most accurate measurement for human biological age (Hannum et al. 2013; Horvath 2013). A multiplexed test can now reveal an individual’s exact age within 1-3 years of accuracy depending on tissue type (Horvath 2013). In aging humans, DNA methylation is primarily lost on repeats, such as SINEs and LTRs (Jintaridth and Mutirangura 2010; Heyn et al. 2012; Bollati et al. 2009), an occurrence that is not observed in immortalized cells (Wilson and Jones 1983). Why DNA methylation is lost with age is speculated to be linked to age-dependent loss of heterochromatin and decrease of Dnmt1 expression (Jung and Pfeifer 2015). In aging euchromatin, the general trend is towards DNA hypermethylation, however several gene promoters also show age-dependent DNA hypomethylation. Many of the genes promoters that are hypomethylated with age are directly linked to innate immune pathways and pathogenic inflammation (Gowers et al. 2011; Wei et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2002). However, as stated above, euchromatin predominantly undergoes DNA hypermethylation, which occurs preferentially at loci that are tissue specific, such as at bivalent chromatin domains (Rakyan et al. 2010), or near promoters and transcription-factor binding sites (Zampieri et al. 2015; Sun et al. 2014; Maegawa et al. 2010). Methylation changes to gene promoters has been proven to have immediate consequences on distal gene regulation (Avrahami et al. 2015). It is speculated that the loci with age-associated DNA hypermethylation are normally repressed by the Polycomb repressive complex, and abnormal recruitment of DNA methyltransferases results in their hypermethylation (Beerman et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2014). Histone modifications in aged euchromatin also show large drift. The most important alteration is to H3K4me3, an epigenetic modification that is associated with active transcription and typically found sharply at the transcription start site (TSS). H3K4me3 becomes less specific with age in humans and mouse (Shah et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2014), and knockdown of enzymes responsible for H3K4me3 deposition can either diminish or promote longevity, depending on context (Booth and Brunet 2016). H3K4me1, which typically marks promoter and enhancer sequences (Kim et al. 2010), tends to extend further into genomic loci that also show DNA hypomethylation with age (Fern’andez et al. 2015). Similarly, H3K36me3, which is important for transcriptional elongation and splicing (Edmunds, Mahadevan, and Clayton 2008) also shows an age related decline and is associated with shorter lifespan in S. Cerevisiae (Sen et al. 2015), C. Elegans (Pu et al. 2015) and in the SAMP8 mouse model (Wang et al. 2010). Like other histone modifications, H3K36 methylation has a strong bearing on the assembly of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair components, and loss of H3K36 methylation directly reduces their assembly (Fnu et al. 2011). In summary, genomic aging is associated with an overall net decrease in DNA methylation at repeats and loss of constitutive heterochromatin including H3K9me3 and HP1. In euchromatin, tissue-specific promoters are subject to DNA hypermethylation, and histone marks that typically mark promoters such as H3K4me1 extend beyond their normal territory. This reorganization is coincident with decreased transcriptional efficiency in genes and increased transcription of ribosomal DNA repeats, satellite repeats and transposable elements. Sustained transcriptional de-regulation may then result in an oncogene-induced senescence, where the cellular response is to inhibit tumorigenesis and direct cell-cycle arrest, resulting in the formation of senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs). 1.3 The Aging Neuronal Epigenome 1.3.1 DNA Methylation and Hydroxymethylation in Aged Neurons While there is some evidence as to what occurs to the epigenome in aging neurons, evidence is often conflicting and is far from consensus. Most of the earliest publications studying DNA methylation in aging and diseased human brains made contradictory claims, owing to their study designs, which suffered from low throughput, low specificity and bias (for a review see Yokoyama, Rutledge, and Medici (2017)). Most human evidence now points to an age-dependent loss of DNA methylation in the brain, which is strongly corroborated by work done in mice, such as cognitive deficits observed in mice haplosuficient for DNMT1 (L. Liu et al. 2011). In patients with Alzheimer’s disease for example, this translates into a correlation where higher levels of LINE-1 DNA methylation have better cognitive performance than their counterparts (Bollati et al. 2011). One vitally important discovery of the past decade is that 5-hydroxy-methyl-cytosine (5hmC) is particularly enriched in the brain, which may explain some of the early confusion, as many techniques cannot discern between DNA methylation (5mC) and DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC). In contrast to 5mC, 5hmC is typically associated with active transcription (Nestor et al. 2012). As such, during neurogenesis 5hmC is dynamically regulated and in some regions this regulation continues well into adulthood (Hahn et al. 2013; Szulwach et al. 2011). Unlike normal 5mC DNA methylation, which is found on CpG-rich promoters and repeats, 5hmC occurs on active gene bodies which are tissue specific. In profiling 5hmC across different brain areas such as the hippocampus and cerebellum, multiple differentially hydroxy-methylated Regions (DhMRs) have been observed corresponding to gene activation specific to that tissue (Szulwach et al. 2011). The general trend observed is that in neurons, 5hmC tends to increase with age (Chen, Dzitoyeva, and Manev 2012; Szulwach et al. 2011; Wagner et al. 2015). In Alzheimer’s disease, increased expression of TET1 has been observed in the hippocampus alongside specific increases of 5hmC at DhMRs in the frontal cortex and hippocampus (Zhao et al. 2017; Bradley-Whitman and Lovell 2013). It is logical to assume the age-dependent increase in 5hmC in the brain is at the expense of 5mC, however DhMRs are highly specific to cell and tissue type, and this may not always be the case. Our understanding of age-dependent dynamics of 5mC/5hmC in the brain is still limited and will benefit from continued high-throughput sequencing approaches in the future. 1.3.2 Chromatin in the Aging Brain Much of what we know of specific changes to the histone code in the aging brain comes from animal models. In drosophila, the aforementioned age-related loss of heterochromatin coincides with increased transcription of several retrotransposons such as R1 and R2 (LINE-like elements) and Gypsy (an LTR retrotransposon) over the course of normal aging (Li et al. 2013). This age-related activation of retrotransposons results in the accumulation of de novo insertions begin in 2 to 4 week old adults, which is old age for a fly. Importantly, transposon activation can be attenuated by promoting heterochromatin integrity via overexpression of HP1 (Larson et al. 2012) or by caloric restriction (Wood et al. 2016). In the aged mouse brain, heterochromatin marks H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 are reduced on LINE1 and the murine endogenous retrovirus IAP, resulting in their expression (Ryu et al. 2011). A separate study looking at the aged mouse hippocampus has also reported an age-dependent decrease in SUV420H2, one of the enzymes responsible for H4K20me3 deposition (Sanchez et al. 2015). The same study found an age-dependent loss of ZFP57, the KRAB-ZFP responsible for maintaining DNA methylation at imprinted loci. An age-related loss of imprinting control would result in dysregulation of a wide range of genes, such as the imprinted long non-coding RNA Gas5, which sees an age-related increase in transcription in the hippocampus and is associated with impaired learning (Meier et al. 2010). Given the number and variety of maternally imprinted and paternally imprinted genes (Williamson et al. 2013), careful understanding of imprinting regions altered in the aging brain would vastly help our understanding of parent-of-origin effects in age-related cognitive decline. Evidence for specific changes to chromatin composition in aging human neurons is lacking, and when available, often contradictory. This may be largely due to conflation by heterogenous neurodegenerative disease states such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or by brain region specific differences. However, there is ample evidence of increases in repetitive element transcription in several neurodegenerative disorders (Coufal et al. 2011; Douville et al. 2011; Jeong et al. 2010; Wenxue Li et al. 2015; Kaneko et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2013; Li et al. 2012; Mameli et al. 2013; Perron et al. 2005), which arise undeniably due to deficiencies in their repression. Additionally, DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, which have been tested as therapies for cancer and neurodegenerative disease, actually induce cryptic transcription start sites in LTRs (Brocks et al. 2017). Increased non-genic expression in aging and neurodegenerative states are not limited to retro-transposons, as multiple lncRNAs show neurodegenerative and age-associated increases (Nishimoto et al. 2013; Salvi and Mekhail 2015) including an age-dependent accumulation of circRNA (Gruner et al. 2016; Larsen et al. 2018). In the case of Amyotrophic Lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration, a potent risk factor are mutations to the TAR DNA-binding protein-43 ( TDP-43 ), an aggregation-prone, multifunctional RNA-binding protein. TDP-43 shows extensive binding to intronic RNA and RNA derived from LINE, SINE and LTR transposons, often localizing in stress granules (Li et al. 2012). In cortical tissue from patients with fronto-temporal lobar degeneration this association between TDP-43 and transposon RNA was drastically reduced (Li et al. 2012). While it was established that human TDP-43 can disturb siRNA-mediated retrotransposon silencing in drosophila (Krug et al. 2017), further examinations suggest that increases in repetitive element transcription can not be explained by TDP-43 alone (Prudencio et al. 2017). It is thus conceivable that natural age-related increases in retrotransposon expression is synergistic with TDP-43 deficits in generating ALS pathogenesis. It could be that sustained recruitment of TDP-43 to stress granules by transposon RNA or abnormally processed ncRNA (Wu et al. 2016) results in either sequestration or prolonged aggregation of TDP-43 prion-like particles (Nonaka et al. 2013). In tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease, a body of recent works across drosophila mouse and man has shown that both hyper-phosphorylated tau and an over abundance of WT tau induces global chromatin relaxation and heterochromatin including loss of drosophila HP1\\(\\alpha\\) and SUV39H1. This tau-induced chromatin relaxation results in the expression of previously heterochromatinized genes (Frost et al. 2014) and activation of transposable elements (Guo et al. 2018). Conversely, complete loss of tau affects the composition, structure, and repair of neuronal pericentric heterochromatin (Mansuroglu et al. 2016), suggesting that tau has distinct roles in maintaining neuronal chromatin architectures. Outside of distinctly pathogenic environments, the defining feature of neurons, namely their ability to transmit electrochemical signals by transient membrane depolarization, leave them exceptionally prone to epigenetic drift. During neuronal excitation, it has been shown that serine 10 of histone 3 (H3S10ph) is phosphorylated following periods of extended neuronal depolarization (Noh et al. 2014). This was surprising, given H3S10 phosphorylation is a mark normally observed in mitosis which causes HP1 proteins to be ejected from histones due to steric hindrance with the adjacent methylated H3K9me3 (Hirota et al. 2005). In neurons, HP1 proteins are also ejected from chromatin following stimulation while ATRX is capable of binding to the combination H3K9me3S10ph. Retention of ATRX on heterochromatin is important at repetitive elements and imprinted loci during neuronal activity (Noh et al. 2014; Voon et al. 2015). It is presumed that following a neuron’s return from extended excitability to the resting state, HP1 proteins re-assemble along with ATRX and other heterochromatin components. Figure 1.4: Age-related augmentation of Activity-DEPendent Transposition. Left column: Young neurons correctly repair activity-dependent DSBs by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway (bottom panel) (Madabhushi et al., 2015). Right column: In aged neurons, epigenetic drift results in poor definition of normal chromatin compartments defined by histone modifications and DNA methylation. An ‘epigenetic scar’ is likely to form in the vicinity of the enhancer/promoter region, due to improper re-establishment of epigenetic marks following a lifetime of DNA repair, and repetitive sequences are no longer repressed by DNA methylation and H3K9me3. It is likely that such epigenetic drift diverts DNA repair to transcription coupled homologous recombination (TCHR), which uses the available repeat-rich lncRNA as a template. Homologous recombination between repetitive lncRNA could result in (a) large deletions, (b) alternative TSS generation and (c) insertions at the immediate early gene promoter. (Newman et al., 2017) The second consequence of neuronal activity is DNA damage, which consistently increases the likelihood of heterochromatin loss (Oberdoerffer and Sinclair 2007). The high metabolism of neurons is directly linked with higher oxidative DNA damage in normal aging and multiple neurodegenerative disorders (for a review see Copped‘e and Migliore (2015)). If that is not enough, a miraculous feature of neuronal chromatin is the property of activity-dependent DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Following sustained neuronal activity, DNA double-strand breaks are required for the induction of several immediate early genes, which enables contact of the immediate early gene promoter with its respective enhancer (Madabhushi et al. 2015). With age, one could easily imagine a scenario where loss of heterochromatin boundaries and expression of repetitive elements adversely affect the normal repair of activity-dependent double strand breaks (Figure 1.4). While neuronal activity-dependent DSBs are normally repaired by blunt non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), an altered epigenetic landscape may direct DNA repair to use transcription-coupled homologous recombination (TCHR) repair (Wei, Levine, and Lan 2016; McDevitt et al. 2018), where RNA is used as a template. In an aged neuron, elevated levels of repetitive element RNA may be incorrectly used as repair template and result in Activity DEPendent Transposition (ADEPT), generating deletions, alterations to splicing, and insertions (reviewed in Newman et al. (2016); Newman et al. (2017), Figure 1.4). 1.4 Objective Central to heterochromatin stability, maintenance, and DNA methylation are the HP1 proteins. Here we seek to examine definitively in a mammalian system how the protracted loss of HP1 proteins directly affects neuronal fitness and cognition, and if these affects recapitulate an accelerated variant of normal aging. Specifically: does loss of HP1 accelerate age-related decreases in neuronal complexity and cognition, what are the molecular mechanism(s) behind this, and can areas of the mouse genome that are sensitive to HP1 loss inform on the progression of epigenomic aging in human neurons. 1.5 HP1 Proteins - A Background Heterochromatin Protein 1 was first identified in Drosophila Melanogaster as mutation Su(var)205, for its ability to dominantly suppress position-effect variegation (James and Elgin 1986). Following successful cloning of the full gene product, it was revealed that this protein primarily localizes to pericentromeric heterochromatin (James et al. 1989) and is highly conserved, found in both plants and animals (Singh et al. 1991). In addition to binding to the globular portion of Histone 3 (Canzio et al. 2013), HP1 proteins are famous for their high affinity binding to di and tri methylated H3K9 (Bannister et al. 2001; Lachner et al. 2001), a function that is important for its role in mediating induction and spreading of heterochromatin. Figure 1.5: Structure of Mammalian HP1 Proteins. (A) Protein sequences and domains of mouse HP1 proteins (modified from Maison and Almouzni 2004). (B) Surface view of an HP1 CSD dimer (one monomer is pink, the other is blue) binding to a CAF-1 peptide (stick model). (C) HP1 chromodomains form an aromatic cage to bind H3K9me3. (B,C) modified from Billur et al., (2010). The ABG’s of HP1 Proteins HP1 proteins are encoded by subset of chomobox ( Cbx ) genes so named due to the presence of a chromobox domain in their protein product. In mammals, three homologs of HP1 exist, termed HP1\\(\\alpha\\) ( Cbx5 ), HP1\\(\\beta\\) ( Cbx1 ) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) ( Cbx3 ). All three display a high degree of sequence similarity, each containing a variable hinge domain and two structured domains, the chromodomain (CD) and the chromoshadow domain (CSD). The chromodomain, which is found on many proteins, recognizes H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 with increasing affinity (Bannister et al. 2001; Nielsen et al. 2002). The chromoshadow domain is unique to HP1 proteins, and is capable of dimerization and binding to proteins which contain a PxVxL motif (Smothers and Henikoff 2000; Brasher et al. 2000; Thiru et al. 2004). Finally, the variable hinge region connects both CD and CSD domains, and is implicated in sequence-independent RNA and DNA binding (Keller et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2000) (Figure 1.5). The structure of HP1 proteins enables unique interactions with methyltransferases and methylated histones resulting in a feed-forward heterochromatinization following a nucleation event. After nucleation induces deposition of H3K9me3 (typically by SETDB1) and recruitment of HP1, HP1 recruits further methyltransferases such as G9a, GLP or SUV39H1, which in turn methylate adjacent histones, recruiting more HP1, which recruits more methylransferase et cetera, extending the repressive heterochromatin environment (Figure 1.6). The creation of such large H3K9me3 domains is akin to building hills in Waddington’s landscape (Figure 1.1): H3K9me3 at reprogramming resistant regions (RRRs, generated by SUV39H1/2) (Matoba et al. 2014) and developmental regulators (generated by SETDB1 and bound by HP1\\(\\gamma\\)) form barriers to efficient reprogramming of murine induced pluripotent stem cells. Figure 1.6: Function of HP1 Proteins. HP1 proteins are able to bind to the globular portion of Histone 3 via their chromoshadow domain (CSD), and bind with high affinity to H3K9me3 via their chromo domain (CD). Many proteins are known to interact with HP1, and in doing so can sustain or perturb heterochromatin (top row). Because HP1 proteins also interact with histone methyltransferases (HMTs) such as SUV39H1, recruitment of HP1 to H3K9me3 may result in a feed-forward loop resulting further methylation of adjacent nucleosomes and spreading of heterochromatin (bottom row). Modified from Canzio et. al., (2014) The nuclear distribution of HP1 homologs is distinct along with their functions. Mammalian HP1\\(\\alpha\\) and HP1\\(\\beta\\) associate primarily with constitutive heterochromatin while HP1\\(\\gamma\\) has a more euchromatic distribution, associating with active genes and being important for transcriptional elongation (Minc et al. 1999; Smallwood et al. 2012; Vakoc et al. 2005). The number of euchromatic regions of the genome bound by HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is numerous and depends largely on cell type (Huang et al. 2017; Ostapcuk et al. 2018; Smallwood et al. 2012). HP1 homologs perform different functions despite high sequence homology in their functional domains. The CSD and CD of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) show 87% and 71% sequence identity, respectively, but nonetheless domain-swapping experiments between homologs have revealed non-redundant functions (Canzio, Larson, and Narlikar 2014; Smothers and Henikoff 2001). We now have some understanding of how HP1 proteins function differently, which involve several subtle differences in the CD, CSD and hinge domains. For instance, HP1 binding to H3K9me2/3 can occur in different affinities ranging from 5-40\\(\\mu\\)M depending on both HP1 homolog and post-translational modifications. The phosphorylation of serine residues present only on the N-terminal extension (NTE) of mammalian HP1\\(\\alpha\\) can increase its affinity for H3K9me3 approximately five-fold, close to that of both mouse HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) (Hiragami-Hamada et al. 2011, Nishibuchi et al. 2014). Such a property may facilitate rapid assembly/disassembly of a heterochromatin domain in the presence of a kinase/phosphatase, which seems to be the case, as NTE phosphorylation of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) persists during cell cycle (Hiragami-Hamada et al. 2011). By contrast, negatively charged glutamate residues replace most of the serines in the NTE of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\), and an increased number of acidic residues in the NTE of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) make the HP1\\(\\gamma\\)-CD-H3K9me3 complex more flexible than the HP1\\(\\beta\\)-CD-H3K9me3 complex (Machado, Dans, and Pantano 2010). In line with such differences, recent work has shown that it is HP1\\(\\alpha\\) that interacts with CTCF in pericentric heterochromatin, and its loss can result in hypercompaction through excess spreading of H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 by HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\). Conversely, depletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) results in decompaction of pericentric heterochromatin (Bosch-Presegu’e et al. 2017), and depletion of both HP1\\(\\alpha\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) abolishes the recruitment of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) to pericentric heterochromatin (Dialynas et al. 2007). Additionally, HP1 proteins show differential binding via their CSD domains to the globular core of histone 3. While some studies have observed that HP1\\(\\alpha\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) but not HP1\\(\\beta\\) bind to the PGTVAL motif on the \\(\\alpha\\)N helix of globular H3 (Dawson et al. 2009; Lavigne et al. 2009), elsewhere it has been reported that HP1\\(\\beta\\) does associate with the globular histone (Dialynas 2006). Additionally, two residues away from the PGTVAL motif on the histone core, HP1\\(\\alpha\\) is sensitive to phosphorylation of tyrosine 41 (Y41), which inhibits its binding. Furthermore, HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is insensitive to Y41 phosphorylation, which is consistent with phosphorylation of this mark being correlated with transcription (Dawson et al. 2009; Lavigne et al. 2009). Essentially this means that HP1\\(\\beta\\) does not bind core H3, HP1\\(\\gamma\\) always can, and HP1\\(\\alpha\\) can conditionally bind to it in the absence of Y41 phosphorylation. The largest source of functional diversity perhaps comes from the hinge region, which is both poorly conserved and variable in length between HP1 homologs. In addition to containing the nuclear localization signal (NLS), phosphorylation and sumoylation modifications have been observed at the hinge region (LeRoy et al. 2009; Maison et al. 2011). Sumoylation of the hinge region can promote de novo targeting of mouse HP1\\(\\alpha\\) but not HP1\\(\\beta\\) or HP1\\(\\gamma\\) to pericentric heterochromatin by associating with RNA. More importantly, phosphorylation of serine 83 in the hinge of human HP1\\(\\gamma\\) both increases its localization to euchromatin and increases its interaction with XRCC6 (also known as Ku70), a central DNA repair protein (Lomberk et al. 2006). Figure 1.7: HP1 Protein-Protein Interaction Network. Protein-Protein interactions (PIPs) were queried for each HP1 homolog from published data hosted on BioGrid in 2015 (http://thebiogrid.org). Newman 2015, unpublished. An appreciation of such functional diversity comes naturally when looking at a network of documented protein-protein interactions that occur with HP1 proteins (Figure 1.7). Generated in 2015, this protein-protein network is by no means exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive, it does serve as a starting point for documented interactions common to all three homologs, those common to two, and unique interactions. Recent high-throughput approaches such as mass-spec offer much more unbiased measurements of protein binding (for example see Ostapcuk et al. (2018)) that can inform on which proteins are interactors of individual HP1 homologs. It has long been suspected that the essential function of HP1 proteins may lay outside its classical H3K9me3 binding ability, given double mutants of SUV39H1/H2 are viable, but HP1\\(\\beta\\) mutants are perinatal lethal (Billur, Bartunik, and Singh 2010). Evidence for such roles is forthcoming, as it is now understood that HP1 proteins can create locally restricted repression in the absence of H3K9me3 by associating with chromatin remodellers ADNP and CHD4 (Ostapcuk et al. 2018). HP1 proteins were known to recruit ADNP to H3K9me3 positive heterochromatin to silence major satellites (Mosch et al. 2011), however Ostapcuk and colleagues observed that CHD4-ADNP-HP1 (ChAHP)-mediated repression occurred independently of H3K9me3. They observed that ChAHP-mediated repression regulates the expression of genes that are crucial for maintaining distinct cellular fates. While ChAHP complexes use primarily HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\), deletion of all three HP1 homologs was required to perturb their role in ChAHP repression, despite HP1\\(\\alpha\\) only weakly binding to ADNP. Finally, recent work has begun to shift how we perceive heterochromatinization by HP1 proteins. Biophysical studies have characterized nucleation and heterochromatinization of HP1 proteins to be consistent with the physical properties of liquid phase separation (Larson et al. 2017; Strom et al. 2017). These experiments examined how under certain conditions HP1 proteins oligomerize to form liquid-phase separated droplets due to electrostatic interactions (Figure 1.8). Such experiments observed that such droplet formation only occurred with drosophila HP1a and human HP1\\(\\alpha\\), where the phosphorylation of the N-terminal extension of human HP1\\(\\alpha\\) is integral to droplet generation. This greatly contributes to our understanding of how heterochromatin domains can be both stable and dynamic. DNA and HP1-interacting proteins can be incorporated into the ‘heterochromatin phase’, while non-interacting proteins are excluded and remain in the ‘euchromatin phase’. Strom et al., (2017) could confirm that the boundary between these phases is a strong barrier to protein diffusion. Figure 1.8: HP1\\(\\alpha\\) can induce liquid phase separation to drive heterochromatin domain formation. Modified from Strom et. al., (2017). Collectively, HP1 proteins maintain a diverse repertoire of functions. They have proven roles in pluripotency (Sridharan et al. 2013), spermatogenesis (Brown et al. 2010; Leonard et al. 2015), mitosis (Liu et al. 2014), DNA methylation (Smallwood et al. 2007; Rottach et al. 2010), DNA repair (Kalousi et al. 2015; Soria and Almouzni 2013; Luijsterburg et al. 2009), cancer (Dialynas, Vitalini, and Wallrath 2008), transcriptional elongation (Smallwood et al. 2012; Vakoc et al. 2005), RNA splicing (Yearim et al. 2015), imprinting (Bosch-Presegu’e et al. 2017; Leung et al. 2014; Quenneville et al. 2011), and the silencing of repeat, regulatory and genic elements (Ayyanathan 2003; Bilodeau et al. 2009; Karimi et al. 2011; Maksakova et al. 2013; Ostapcuk et al. 2018; Raurell-Vila et al. 2017; Schultz et al. 2002). Yet, only two studies so far have investigated the role of HP1 proteins in neurons. Recent in vitro experiments suggest HP1\\(\\gamma\\) to be important in specifying neuronal lineage (Huang et al. 2017), while animals with constitutive deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) show mitotic deficits in cortical progenitors and the formation of neuromuscular junctions (Aucott et al. 2008). Here I examine in detail how all three HP1 proteins modulate the development, maturation and aging of pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. References "],

Over the course of one year of crossing and re-crossing, we found that HP1\\(\\alpha\\) null allele homozygosity did not follow mendelian ratios and was extremely rare. Of the few ‘HP1\\(\\alpha\\) null’ brains that could be obtained, positive staining could be observed in euchromatin using an anti-HP1\\(\\alpha\\) antibody. It was then necessary to check HP1\\(\\alpha\\) protein expression in this mutant. Figure 2.1: HP1\\(\\alpha\\) and HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T Transcript Maps. (A) Wild-type, full length HP1\\(\\alpha\\) transcript annotated with major domains and point mutations. (B) The constructed HP1\\(\\alpha\\) null allele gives rise to the truncated HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T transcript that lacks exon II. In-frame transcription is initiated at either of two ATG codons found inside exon III. The resulting HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T protein contains full length hinge and chromoshadow domains but does not have a functional chromodomain, which runs around 12 kDa, compared to the wild-type HP1\\(\\alpha\\) protein of 22 kDa found in C57BL/6J mice (C). While no HP1\\(\\alpha\\) is transcribed from the HP1\\(\\alpha\\) NeO allele containing the STOP cassette (Methods 4.1.1), a truncated ~12 kDa protein could be recognized in brains with the HP1\\(\\alpha\\) null allele (Figure 2.1C). To identify this protein, mRNA was isolated from these animals and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Using primers specific to the 5’UTR and 3’UTR of HP1\\(\\alpha\\), I could amplify a truncated 548 bp isoform of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) being transcribed from the HP1\\(\\alpha\\) ‘null’ allele, which was dubbed HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T. Sequencing of this transcript confimed that an in-frame coding sequence could be initiated from either of two ATG codons found inside exon III (Figure 2.1B). Given HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T retains hinge and CSD domains but lacks a functional chromodomain, I suspected it could still heterodimerize with HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) interact with other proteins but would no longer bind to H3K9me3. To test this, I cloned a c-terminal HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T-GFP fusion protein for expression in cells to observe where the protein is localized in the nucleus. Similar to mutations that inhibit H3K9me3 binding (HP1\\(\\alpha\\)F44E) or dimerization (HP1\\(\\alpha\\)I165E), HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T does not localize to H3K9me3 positive heterochromatin (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2: Sub-Nuclear Localization of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) Mutants. C-terminal HP1\\(\\alpha\\)-GFP fusion proteins enable clean visualization of sub-nuclear localization. In ES cells, wild-type HP1\\(\\alpha\\) localizes to both euchromatic and H3K9me3+ heterochromatin. HP1\\(\\alpha\\)F44E, HP1\\(\\alpha\\)I165E, and HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T are not found at H3K9me3 chromocenters. The presence of a functional CSD domain on HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T was a cause of greater concern, given it could conceivably not only bind to HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\), but could act as a dominant negative to any proteins containing a PxVxL motif. This is likely, as when I over-expressed HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T, heterochromatic localization of HP1\\(\\beta\\) was markedly less (Figure 2.3A). HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T may also function as a dominant negative for HP1\\(\\gamma\\), sequestering its binding to H3K9me3 foci, however this effect is less obvious as HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is normally found in both euchromatin and heterochromatin (Figure 2.3B). Figure 2.3: Sub-Nuclear Distribution of HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T, HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\). Over-expression of HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T-GFP in HEK293T cells (select cells marked with dashed outline) results in decreased localization of endogenous HP1\\(\\beta\\) (A) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) (B) to heterochromatin (yellow arrows). There was no doubt that if HP1\\(\\alpha\\) could act a dominant negative for other HP1 proteins it could also do so for non-HP1 proteins. Given the decreased fertility, potential toxicity and confounding nature of HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T, the HP1FEC line was bred back to homozygous wild-type HP1\\(\\alpha\\) allele. From henceforth, all future references to the HP1FEC line assume a wild-type HP1\\(\\alpha\\) allele. 2.2 Expression of HP1 Proteins in the Brain In the developing brain, while weak expression can be observed in the ventricular zone, HP1\\(\\alpha\\) and HP1\\(\\beta\\) are most strongly expressed in post-mitotic neurons in the cortical plate. HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is more uniformly expressed in all strata of the developing cortex, including progenitors of the ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ and SVZ respectively) (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4: Expression of Mammalian HP1 Proteins in the Developing Cerebral Cortex. While HP1 proteins are generally considered to have ubiquitous expression in tissues throughout the body, HP1\\(\\alpha\\) and HP1\\(\\beta\\) are expressed more strongly in post-mitotic neurons of the cortical plate (CP). HP1\\(\\gamma\\) however, which is also found in euchromatin, is observed in progenitor populations in ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ and SVZ, respectively). Scalebar = 25\\(\\mu\\)m 2.3 Mosaic Deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) from Cortical Progenitors Initial experiments were carried out to determine if cell-intrinsic deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) in neocortical progenitors would affect fate acquisition and/or connectivity of resultant HP1 deficient neurons. To do this, I performed In Utero Electroporation (IUE) on HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/fl\\(\\gamma\\)fl/fl E14.5 embryos, where I could introduce plasmid DNA into the lateral ventricles of the developing brain (see methods 4.4.1). This electroporation used a mixture of two plasmids, a Cre expressed consitutively under the CAG promoter (pCAG-Cre) and pCAG-flox-STOP-flox-eGFP (pCAG-FSF-eGFP), a plasmid that expresses cytoplasmic eGFP in the presence of Cre. This plasmid combination both induces Cre-mediated recombination of floxed HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) alleles, and allows visualization of electroporated cells via GFP. Figure 2.5: Mosaic Deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) in the Neocortex at E14.5. Mosaic deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) in cortical progenitors by electroporation with pCAG-Cre and pCAG-FSF-GFP does not impede migration or normal contralateral axon projection (Top Row). GFP labelled neurons in upper layers were confirmed to be deficient for HP1\\(\\beta\\) (Middle Row) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) (Bottom Row), which corresponds with Cre expression (Bottom Row). Draq5 was used to stain all nuclei. Cell intrinsic deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) at E14.5 did not affect normal positioning or axon projection (Figure 2.5). This implies that either HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) are not explicitly required for the final specification of neurons cell instrinsically, or genomic deletion at E14.5 is not sufficient to induce a noticeable effect due to the stability of HP1 proteins already present in the nucleus at E14.5. 2.4 Deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) &amp; HP1\\(\\gamma\\) from the Emx1-lineage. 2.4.1 Cell Fate in Cortical Neurons Emx1Cre mediated recombination results in the successful deletion of HP1 proteins from pyramidal cells of the developing cortex (Figure 2.6A). Figure 2.6: Emx1-Cre -Mediated Deletion of HP1 Proteins from the Cerebral Cortex. (A): Staining of P0 somatosensory cortex reveals that HP1 proteins are deleted from pyramidal cells in the presence of Emx1-Cre. (B): Cell Fate and Laminarization is Unaffected in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO Cortices. Specification of upper layer neurons marked by SATB2 and deep layer neurons marked by CTIP2 in the cortical plate (CP) is unperturbed following deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\), HP1\\(\\gamma\\), or both. Surprisingly, cell fate and laminarization is unaffected in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flEmx1Cre, HP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre and HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/fl\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre cortices, as evidenced by normal distribution of upper layer neurons marked by SATB2 and deep layer neurons marked by CTIP2 (Figure 2.6B). Cells remaining positive for HP1\\(\\beta\\) or HP1\\(\\gamma\\) are negative for SATB2, and could be interneurons, epithelial or other cell types that are non- Emx1 lineage (Figure 2.7). Figure 2.7: Cells in upper layers of the cerebral cortex remaining positive for HP1\\(\\beta\\) or HP1\\(\\gamma\\) in the HP1DKO mutant are negative for SATB2 (white circles), excluding them from pyramidal lineage. Scalebar = 25\\(\\mu\\)m 2.4.2 Imprinted Loci Given the known involvement of HP1 with the ZFP57-KAP1 repressive complex in controlling imprinted loci (Voon and Gibbons 2016), the expression of several imprinted loci was profiled by in situ hybridization. While some imprinted genes maintain expression in mature neurons such as Plagl1, no differences could be detected in HP1 mutants at P0 (Figure 2.8). Additionally, probes designed for canonically imprinted Impact, Inpp5f, Gnas, Grb10, Mdga1, Rasgrf1 or Pip5k1c did not reveal any changes in tissue expression following single or double deletion of HP1 proteins in the Emx1 lineage (data not shown). Figure 2.8: Imprinted Loci Are unaffected in HP1 Mutants at P0. Shown here is the in situ-hybridization signal for Plagl1. 2.5 Perturbed Regulation of Retroelements in HP1 Mutants Given the known association of HP1 proteins with the KAP1 repressive complex and its role in silencing repetitive elements, I hypothesized that their absence may affect the normal regulation of repetitive elements. To examine this in the brain, I designed consensus RNA probes to detect all copies of a particular retrotransposon by in situ hybridization (ISH). 2.5.1 LINE1 An RNA probe designed against a 700 bp region of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of LINE1 revealed robust, ubiquitous expression in post-mitotic neurons of the cortex and hippocampus in both wild-type and mutant (Figure 2.9). While high expression in the dentate gyrus is concordant with the large body of work examining LINE-driven somatic mosaicism there (McConnell et al. 2013; Muotri et al. 2009; Thomas, Paquola, and Muotri 2012), it was surprising to observe such high abundance of transcripts in all post-mitotic neurons of the cortex. Given such abundance in wild-type, it was not feasible to discern any changes in LINE transcription in HP1 mutant brains by ISH. Notably, in the hippocampus, LINE1 expression is evident in the dentate gyrus as well as CA1 and CA3 fields. Figure 2.9: In Situ Hybridization for LINE transcripts in adult wild-type and HP1 \\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO brains. LINE transcripts are already highly abundant in wild-type post-mitotic neurons. 2.5.2 Class III ERVs To examine possible dysregulation of Class III murine endogenous retroviruses, I designed a 450bp consensus probe to test all transcripts derived from MERVL-MT2, a murine ERVL/Class III endogenous retrovirus. The probe for MERVL that would hybridize to RNA transcripts originating from approximately ~205 MERVL loci. MERVL-derived transcripts are important at the 2 cell (2C) stage of embryonic development and both their standalone expression and of MERVL-derived chimeras is tightly associated with naive pluripotency (Macfarlan et al. 2012). Modest expression of MERVL derived transcripts can be observed in wild-type brains, and similar levels could be observed in HP1 mutants (Figure 2.10). Figure 2.10: In Situ Hybridization Using a Consensus Probe for MERVL. A probe was designed around a consensus sequence common to all MERVL elements. MERVL transcripts appear unaltered in HP1 mutant brains. 2.5.3 Class II ERVs To examine possible dysregulation of Class II endogenous retroviruses, I designed a consensus probe for Intracisternal Alpha Particle (IAP), an evolutionary recent murine endogenous retrovirus of the ERVK family. To meet this end I created an RNA probe for a section of the gag domain of IAP. A BLAST query predicted that such a sequence would hybridize to RNA transcripts originating from at least ~196 IAP loci. While IAP transcripts are normally silenced in both wild-type and single mutant brains, a robust de-repression of IAP elements could be observed in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) double mutant (Figure 2.11). Figure 2.11: Intracisternal Alpha Particle (IAP) elements are de-repressed in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO. In situ hybridization on various HP1 mutants using an RNA probe for a sequence common to IAP familly members. IAP transcripts are strongly de-repressed in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO, especially in the hippocampus. To ensure the signal observed by the consensus probe was only hybridizing to IAP elements, I designed a separate probe that recognized a unique sequence on an IAP element found on chromosome 2. This RNA probe for a unique IAP sequence recapitulated the findings observed with the consensus probe, where robust de-repression could be observed in post-mitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Figure 2.12). IAP de-repression was confirmed to continue into adulthood (2.13), where it can be clearly observed that IAP de-repression in the hippocampus is restricted to CA1 and CA3 fields and absent from the dentate gyrus. This is a notable contrast from the expression of LINE1, which can be normally observed in all pyramidal fields of the hippocampus (Figure 2.9). Differences in cortical thickness in caudal portions of HP1DKO animals are addressed in section 2.6.2. Figure 2.12: ISH of unique IAP Element on P0 brains. A probe designed around a unique region on an evolutionary recent IAP element on chromosome 2 confirms specificity of the IAP consensus probe. Figure 2.13: Sustained IAP De-Repression in the Adult HP1β/γ DKO Brain. In situ hybridization using the IAP consensus probe in 3 month old adult brains. 2.5.4 De Novo Retrotransposition Given multiple full-length copies of IAP elements capable of autonomous retrotransposition exist in the mouse (Dewannieux et al. 2004; Maksakova et al. 2006; Saito et al. 2008), I sought to determine if rates of de novo transpositions were increased in HP1 mutant brains where IAP elements are de-repressed. Namely, do a subset of the IAP transcripts we observe encode for full-length autonomous retrotransposons? To examine this, GFP sensors encoding autonomous and non-autonomous IAP elements (pFL and pDE1 respectively, Figure 2.14, (Horie et al. 2007)) were introduced by in utero electroporation (IUE) into wild-type and HP1 mutant cortices (Figure 2.15). Figure 2.14: Autonomous and Non-Autonomous IAP Sensors used to detect De Novo Retrotransposition. (Top): The pFL plasmid encodes a full length IAP element followed by an antisense GFP containing an intron. This construct can autonomously integrate into the genome, and will only express GFP upon integration and is thus an autonomous retrotransposon. The pDE1 plasmid encodes an IAP element with an internal deletion rendering it incapable to retrotranspose on its own (it is nonautonomous). In the presence of a functional (autonomous) IAP provided in trans, retrotransposition of pDE1 can be made possible. (Bottom): Only following successful transcription, splicing and genomic integration can GFP be expressed, thus the presence of GFP informs on de novo genomic integration(s). Following exogenous introduction of the autonomous IAP sensor (pFL), de novo genomic integrations could be observed in both wild type and HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO cortices with similar frequencies (Figure 2.15A). While introduction of the defunct IAP sensor pDE1 into wildtype never resulted in any integrations measured by GFP positive cells (n = 6), when introduced into HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO cortex several integration events could be observed (Figure 2.15B). Figure 2.15: De-Repressed IAP Transcripts Facilitate De Novo Retrotransposition in Trans. Introduction by in utero electroporation (IUE) of autonomous and non-autonomous IAP integration sensors at E14 and observed at E18. The introduction of a non-autonomous IAP pDE1 into wildtype does not result in integration, however integrations can be observed when introduced into HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO brains, where IAP elements are de-repressed. Because pDE1 requires the presence of a functional IAP for genomic integration, this infers a subset of IAP elements de-repressed in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO are functionally autonomous retrotransposons. 2.6 Sustained HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) Deficiency Adversely Affects Neuronal Complexity, Function and Cognition The HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre mutants provided an interesting model. While neuronal differentiation proceeds relatively normally -at least in terms of classical identity, HP1 double mutants exhibit precocious de-repression of endogenous retroviruses, a phenotype that emerges gradually with normal aging. The question was then posed “What is the functional consequence to the organism when sustained de-repression of such elements occurs in neurons?” To answer this, behavioral phenotyping was performed in addition to descriptive volumetrics and histology. 2.6.1 Behavior Seizures Upon initial handling, it was observed that many HP1FEC animals descended into brief tonic-clonic seizures following novel stimulus, such as a cage change or routine handling. Such seizures typically included a violent convulsion stage lasting about 5 seconds, where in the most extreme cases included excessive salivation. Such convulsions were followed by a 15-30 second period of stupor where the animal was non-responsive. Following this period of stupor, animals exhibited entirely normal behavior. After these initial observations, I installed a seizure log where seizures could be documented by animal staff and myself. Seizures were recorded from April 2015 until February 2017 (Figure 2.16). While seizures occurred primarily in HP1\\(\\beta\\) animals, some were observed in the other genotypes. It should be noted that because these observations rely on animal staff reporting the correct earcode of the animal, rather than a concrete genotype, it is possible that some observations were inaccurately reported, such as those seen in wildtype. Figure 2.16: Seizures in HP1 Mutants. Seizures were documented in HP1FEC animals in their home cages in the animal facility as well as those undergoing behavioral testing. Several behavioral tests were used to test for alterations to exploratory behavior, anxiety, and learning and memory in young and aged HP1FEC animals. Young (3 months) and Aged (13-14 months) male mice were tested in Open Field Activity, Cued Context Fear Learning, Paired-Pulse Inhibition, the Barnes Maze, Social Activity Monitor, HomeCageScan and Nest Construction. Detailed results of HomeCageScan and Cued Context Fear Learning can be found in Appendix 5.1. Prior to all behavioral phenotyping, animals were assessed using a modified SHIRPA to ensure animals did not have any physical limitations that could bias behavioral testing, such as deficits in vision, audition, grip strength or locomotion. A total of 42 animals (15 WT, 11 HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO, 6 HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO, 10 HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\)DKO) completed the aged time point, where 4 died (2 WT, 1 HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO, 1 HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\)DKO) between young and aged testing. All of the following box and whisker plots are comprised of median and 25th and 75th percentiles, where whiskers extend no further than 1.5X the interquartile range. All line charts plot the mean and standard error as a ribbon surrounding the line. Open Field activity Anxiety and exploration was measured using a simple open field test, where animals are placed in the center of a square open field and their activity in both the center and the periphery is tracked over the course of 10 minutes (Figure 2.17). In young animals, significant decreases in average ambulation velocity and percent activity were observed in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO animals. This effect was due primarily to a strong initial freezing response in roughly half of the HP1\\(\\beta\\) animals following entrance of the animal into the center of the arena at the beginning of the test. This initial freezing response in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO animals was akin to non-convulsive status epilepticus rather than a fear response. Typically midway through the test HP1\\(\\beta\\) animals began normal exploration and avoidance of the center. In aged animals, the initial freezing response could be observed in a subset of HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO animals, however the strongest effect was seen in aged DKO animals, where a majority showed a prolonged stupor in the center of the open field at the beginning of the test.

All statistically significant changes associated with age within genotype are represented by a pound sign (#): ### = p &lt; 0.001, ## = p &lt; 0.01, # = p &lt; 0.05). Social Activity Monitor (SAM) To examine social activity and circadian rhythm, animal activity was measured in their home cages by RFID chip movement. Animals were monitored over 14 days and data was averaged first within animal by hour of the day across all days, then by genotype (Figure 2.18). Figure 2.18: Social Activity of HP1 mutants by Time of Day. The activity of each animal was recorded over a 14-day period. Individual animal activity was averaged by each hour of the day over the duration, then grouped by genotype and age. Plotted here is the mean activity per hour (thick line) along with the standard error of the mean (ribbon) per genotype by age.

HomeCageScan &amp; Animal Microbehaviors Following a 24 hr observation period under active scanning, the frequency and number of discrete bouts of various microbehaviors was quantified. These behaviors are summarized in supplemental Figures 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. Several behaviors associated with increased anxiety could be observed in HP1\\(\\gamma\\) and HP1 double mutants. Notable changes were observed in both the bouts and percent of time spent grooming in HP1\\(\\gamma\\) and HP1DKO young mice, which is sustained with age (Figure 2.19A-B). Additionally, aged HP1DKO animals spend significantly more time eating (Figure 2.19C-D), which corresponds to a tendency for the HP1DKOs to gain weight (Figure 2.19E).

All statistically significant changes associated with age within genotype are represented by a pound sign (#); (### = p &lt; 0.001, ## = p &lt; 0.01, # = p &lt; 0.05). Paired-Pulse Inhibition An examination for alterations in paired-pulse inhibition revealed an age-dependent deficit in HP1DKO animals (Figure 2.20). While all aged animals displayed a tendency towards weaker paired-pulse inhibition, aged HP1DKO animals showed little change in startle response with increasing amplitude of pre-pulse. Figure 2.20: Percent Paired-Pulse Inhibition In HP1 Mutants. Percent paired-pulse inhibition was measured by percent normalizing the measured startle responses in each pre-pulse condition (69 dB, 71 dB and 81 dB) to the measured startle response to the pulse (120 dB). Statistics: two-way ANOVA with bonferroni corrections on multiple comparisons.

All statistically significant changes associated with age within genotype are represented by a pound sign (#); (### = p &lt; 0.001, ## = p &lt; 0.01, # = p &lt; 0.05). Nest Construction Pilot experiments revealed that following the two day separation of male animals from their homecages, return to their homecage resulted in excessive aggression and violence between former cohabitants. For this reason the nest construction test was only tested at the aged timepoint. Nest construction was adversely affected in HP1DKO mutants both in terms of complexity (complexity score, methods 4.5.7) and completion (% nestlet used in constructing the nest) (Figure 2.21). In most cases, HP1DKO animals barely touched the cotton nestlet, leaving it mostly intact (Figure 2.21C). Figure 2.21: Nest Construction and Complexity. (A) plots the amount of nest construction, where any remaining solid nestlet is percent normalized to its initial weight. Nest complexity is qualified in (B), which was measured using a standardized rubrick (see methods). (C) Representative images of nests constructed by each genotype. Statistics: one-way ANOVA with bonferroni corrections on multiple comparisons: *** = p &lt; 0.001, ** = p &lt; 0.01, * = p &lt; 0.05. Barnes Maze Spatial memory of HP1 animals was tested using the Barnes maze (methods 4.5.4). Rather than employing a direct strategy, which would involve directly navigating to the perceived target hole, HP1DKO animals often employed serial search patterns. HP1DKO animals walked clockwise or counter-clockwise around the periphery of the Barnes maze checking every hole (Figure 2.22A). Such poor performance coincided with a significantly longer latency to target and significant decreases in the number of correct visits to target (Figure 2.22B,C). Figure 2.22: HP1 Mutant Performance in the Barnes Maze. Histograms and inset radar plots displaying mean headpokes +SEM per hole (A) reveal search patterns of HP1 mutants in each test by age. Total percent correct visits (B) and latency to target (C) summarize effects by genotype. Statistics: two-way ANOVA with bonferroni corrections on multiple comparisons.

Reduced Dendritic Complexity in Hippocampal CA3 Neurons Dendritic complexity of CA3 neurons was quantified in young and aged HP1 mutants by golgi impregnation (Figure 2.23). Young CA3 neurons from both HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO and HP1DKO animals showed marked reduction in the complexity of their basal dendritic trees (Figure 2.23C, E). This trend continues into aged animals, most prominently in HP1DKO animals, where a drastic loss of basal dendrite complexity can be observed (Figure 2.23D, F). Figure 2.23: Dendritic Complexity of Hippocampal CA3 Neurons in Young and Aged HP1 Mutants. Dendritic complexity was quantified by golgi impregnation followed by Scholl analysis, where intersections of dendrites in each of thirty 10 \\(\\mu\\)m concentric circles were quantified (A). (B) displays representative reconstructions of CA3 neurons. Scholl analysis is plotted for neurons from young (C) and aged animals (D) by genotype, where the thickness of the line corresponds with the standard error around the mean and n refers to the number of neurons counted accross 3 hippocampi from each condition. Box and whisker plots display total apical and basal interactions for young (E) and aged (F) animals. Statistics: two-way ANOVA with bonferroni corrections on multiple comparisons. Asterisks () denote tests within age for differences between genotype: ** = p &lt; 0.001, ** = p &lt; 0.01, * = p &lt; 0.05. All statistically significant changes associated with age within genotype are represented by a pound sign (#); (### = p &lt; 0.001, ## = p &lt; 0.01, # = p &lt; 0.05). Malformation of the Dentate Gyrus It became apparent that the infrapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus was missing in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO and HP1DKO animals (Figure 2.24). In order to understand this deficit, I stained for dividing cells (Ki-67) and post-mitotic granule neurons (Prox1) at early postnatal timepoints when the dentate gyrus is formed (Figure 2.25). At P0, HP1DKO dentate gyrii show a statistically significant decrease in Ki-67 positive cells, and already show a trend towards a decrease in Prox1 positive cells. By postnatal day 8, HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO and HP1DKO animals fail to generate the granular and molecular layers of the infrapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus, which corresponds with a decrease in total area, and in the number of Prox1 positive and proliferative Ki-67 positive cells (Figure 2.25B &amp; C). Given that a subset of DG granule cells in the infrapyramidal blade project to the basal dendrites of CA3 cells, it is likely that dentate gyrus malformations seen in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO and HP1DKO animals are directly linked to the progressive loss of CA3 basal dendritic fields in those animals. It should also be noted that while the infrapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus is lost in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO animals, they do not exhibit the same behavioral abnormalities seen in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\)DKO animals.

Statistics: One-way ANOVA within age for area or marker with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. *** = p &lt; 0.001, ** = p &lt; 0.01, * = p &lt; 0.05. P0: WT n = 10, HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO n = 4, HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO n = 7, HP1DKO n = 11. P8: WT n = 4, HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO n = 3, HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO n = 4, HP1DKO n = 5, where n is a biological replicate Volumetrics A formal characterization of volumetric changes to the cortex and hippocampus in HP1 mutants was obtained by structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A notable reduction in the volume of the total brain, isocortex, hippocampal region and dentate gyrus was confirmed in HP1DKO animals (Figure 2.26). As previously reported (Aucott et al. 2008), the constitutive deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) results in mitotic deficits, suggesting that while cells deficient for HP1\\(\\beta\\) can divide, they have a finite number of divisions that can occur. In the Emx1Cre mouse line, Cre is expressed coincident with Emx1, which begins at E10.5. Normally, the radial glia and subsequent intermediate progenitors undergo a finite amount of divisions in generating the post-mitotic neurons of the cortex and hippocampus. Given the dentate gyrus is one of the last regions to be formed, it stands to reason that HP1\\(\\beta\\)-deficient neural progenitors prematurely exhaust their division potential. In parallel to DG loss, when normalizing to overall brain volume, young animals show specific reductions in slices 10 &amp; 11, which corresponds to the parietal and somatosensory cortices surrounding the hippocampus, and also that seen in Figure 2.13. Notably, when normalized to total brain volume, cortical volumes are not statistically different from wildtype. Figure 2.26: Volumetric Analysis of HP1 mutant brains by Magnetic Resonance Imaging. (A) Representative MRI volume reconstructions with isocortex (cyan), hippocampus (green) and dentate gyrus (red) region masks applied. Total volume of the brain (B), hippocampus (C), dentate gyrus (D) and detailed analysis of the volume of the isocortex (E) is plotted by genotype for both ages.

This suggested that the de-repression we observe in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO cells is likely because HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) repress ERVs by some synergism between separate molecular pathways, rather than be due to HP1 dosage. 2.7.1 HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is Required for H4K20me3 Deposition in Neurons While HP1 proteins collectively have been shown to be important for secondary deposition of H4K20me3 following H3K9 trimethylation (Kourmouli et al. 2005; Schotta 2004), it was surprising to observe that H4K20me3 is completely lost following single deletion of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) (Figure 2.27B). It was confirmed that this effect is specific to HP1\\(\\gamma\\), as H3K9me3, a pre-requisite for H4K20me3, is unaffected (Figure 2.27A). Figure 2.27: H4K20me3 is lost following deletion of HP1\\(\\gamma\\). (A) Trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is unaffected in HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) single and double mutants. (B) Trimethylation of histone 4 lysine 20 (H4K20me3) is lost following deletion of HP1\\(\\gamma\\). Pia - Pia matter, CP - Cortical Plate. 2.7.2 HP1\\(\\gamma\\) binds SUV420H2 via the Chromoshadow Domain In characterizing this phenotype, I tested if HP1\\(\\gamma\\) could bind to SUV420H2, one of the primary enzymes responsible for deposition of H4K20me3, and tested which residues are necessary for this interaction. To do this I generated HP1\\(\\gamma\\) point mutants (Methods, Table 4.4), and observed their ability to Co-ImmunoPrecipitate (Co-IP) and co-localize with myc-tagged SUV420H2 (Figure 2.28). In addition to residues known to be important for HP1\\(\\gamma\\) dimerization, such as I165 and W174, I could determine that F167 and L172 residues are required for HP1\\(\\gamma\\) binding with SUV420H2. Figure 2.28: Localization and Binding of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) with SUV420H2 Requires the Chromoshadow Domain (CSD). Sub-nuclear colocalization of SUV420H2 with wild type HP1-GFP fusion proteins and HP1\\(\\gamma\\)-GFP CSD mutations (A). Co-immunoprecipitation of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) and SUV420H2 requires dimerization of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) (B). Deletion of the entire HP1\\(\\gamma\\) CSD domain or mutation of residues I165, F167, L172 on HP1\\(\\gamma\\) inhibits localization with SUV420H2 (A) and binding (B). 2.7.3 Re-addition of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) can restore H4K20me3 In Vivo To test for sufficiency of HP1\\(\\gamma\\)’s requirement for deposition of H4K20me3, I re-introduced HP1\\(\\gamma\\) into HP1DKO cortices by in-utero electroporation. Re-addition of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) was able to restore H4K20me3 heterochromatic puncta (Figure 2.29), although such puncta appear much smaller than those seen in adjacent wild-type interneurons. Figure 2.29: Re-introduction of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) can restore H4K20me3. Following Emx1-mediated deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) at E10.5, re-introduction of HP1\\(\\gamma\\)-GFP by in utero electroporation (IUE) at E14 restores H4K20me3 (magnification, white circles). 2.7.4 H4K20me3 Loss is Correlated with IAP De-repression Given H4K20me3 is known to be important in silencing repeats, it followed that we could observe an exact correlation with loss of H4K20me3 and the de-repression of IAP elements there. Specifically, we observe that H4K20me3 is highly enriched in post-mitotic neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, which is also where we observe IAP de-repression in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO (Figure 2.30). Figure 2.30: H4K20me3 loss is Correlated with IAP De-Repression. (A) In situ hybridization using the IAP consensus probe on P0 sections followed by IHC for H4K20me3 and DAPI on the next serial section with magnification on the cortex. (B) Combined fluorescent ISH/IHC of IAP and H4K20me3 and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) in the developing CA3 field. Robust IAP signal can be observed in the stratum pyramidale (Str. Pyr.) where HP1\\(\\gamma\\) and H4K20me3 are lost in post-mitotic CA3 neurons. However, as evidenced by ISH (Figure 2.11) and RNAseq from HP1\\(\\gamma\\) deficient neurons (Figure 2.34), loss of H4K20me3 alone is not sufficient to induce de-repression of ERVK elements such as IAPs. Clearly, HP1\\(\\beta\\) contributes an additional mechanism to the repression of these elements. 2.7.5 KAP1, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 are lost at IAP Elements in HP1cTKO ES Cells Figure 2.31: KAP1, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 are Reduced at IAP Elements in HP1cTKO ES Cells. (Top): Read coverage profiles of KAP1, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 ChIP signals split by cluster. (Below): Heatmaps of raw ChIPseq signal (RPKM) over annotated IAPEz internal (-int) fragments, grouped by 3 kmeans clusters. A collaboration with Dr. Jafar Sharif (RIKEN, Yokohama, Japan) enabled interrogation into the effects of the loss of HP1 proteins in a single cell population. HP1cTKO ES cells are transgenic ES cells where all three HP1’s (\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\)) are floxed and can be excised following activation of an ERT2-Cre transgene. In these cells, following the addition of tamoxifen, Cre translocates to the nucleus and excises the targeted alleles, resulting in triple deletion of HP1 proteins. Following 6 days of culture in the presence of tamoxifen, HP1 proteins were verified to be deleted from these cells. Here we were able to observe the effect of complete loss of HP1 proteins on DNA methylation as well as any changes in the distribution of H3K9me3, H4K20me3 and KAP1. In addition to a large number of changes in gene transcription (data not shown), HP1cTKO ES cells show a de-repression of several ERVs, including IAPs, similar to that seen in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKOs. ChIP-seq signal of KAP1, H3K9me3, and H4K20me3 was noticeably reduced from IAP elements (figure 2.31). Consistent with the brain data, H4K20me3 appears to be completely lost, owing to deletion of HP1\\(\\gamma\\). Noticeably, H3K9me3 and KAP1 are also reduced at IAP elements in HP1cTKO cells, implicating HP1 proteins to be necessary for assembly of the KAP1/SETDB1/SUV39H1 repressive complex at these repeats. 2.7.6 DNA Methylation is affected Following loss of HP1 Non-Cannonically Imprinted Genes are Upregulated in HP1DKO Hippocampi While transcriptional changes to a subset of canonically imprinted genes could not be detected by in situ hybridization (section 2.4.2), the neuronally expressed Neuronatin ( Nnat ) and other non-canonically imprinted genes such as Xlr3a and Xlr3c are dysregulated in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO and aged HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO (clusters 4 &amp; 5, Figure 2.34), and are summarized in table 2.1. While the majority of such genes are changed in DKO animals, Neuronatin shows de-repression in aged HP1\\(\\beta\\) KO, suggesting that this may be due to a deficiency in DNMT1 maintaining the methylation imprint over a lifespan without HP1\\(\\beta\\).

Following deletion of all HP1 proteins we could observe loss of DNA methylation at LINE and LTR repeats, and partial hypermethylation of promoters, exons and SINEs. Figure 2.32: HP1cTKO ES Cells Show Abberant DNA Methylation. (A) Scatterplot of methylation in HP1cTKO and WT cells. Hypermethylation of exons and promoters occurs, while intergenic regions become hypomethylated (B). A Circos plot (C) visualizes all changes occuring in the HP1cTKO RRBS data relative to WT by chromosome. The magnitude of change is represented on the radial y axis. The outermost ring represents methylation change density. Inner rings annotate methylation changes occuring to CpG islands, exons, LTRs, LINEs and SINEs respectively. KAP1 is lost from ICRs in HP1cTKO Cells To understand how imprinted loci may be affected in HP1cTKO ES cells, I examined Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) that overlap with ZFP57 binding (data from (Riso et al. 2016)). Figure 2.33A shows the average binding of KAP1, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 across these ICRs, centered at the ZFP57 peak. We observe a distinct loss of KAP1 at ICRs, one example of which is Neuronatin ( Nnat , Figure 2.33B) where KAP1 binding near the CpG island is lost and RRBS shows a shift towards DNA hypermethylation at the CpG. Notably, like HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO hippocampi, Nnat expression is also elevated in HP1cTKO ES cells (Figure 2.33B, bottom track). As methylation of the CpG would normally be associated with transcriptional repression, it is likely the signal observed here is the transcriptionally permissive 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC) modification, which cannot be distinguished from 5mC in bisulfite sequencing. Figure 2.33: KAP1 binding to Imprinting Control Regions is Lost in HP1cTKO ES Cells. (A) KAP1 binding around ZFP57 peaks (Riso 2014) at 20 Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) is lost in HP1cTKO ES cells. (B) Epigenetic Disorder at the Nnat ICR in HP1cTKO ES cells. RRBS track: Blue if methylation is 0-40%, red if methylation is 60-100%, and white if methylation is 40%-60%. 2.8 Transcriptional Dysregulation following HP1 Deficiency Drives UPR and Inflammatory Responses To gain insight into any transcriptional de-regulation occurring in HP1 mutant hippocampi, 32bp paired-end total RNAseq was performed to detect any changes in both coding and non-coding RNA, including repetitive elements. 2.8.1 Genotype Related Changes Differential Gene Expression Surprisingly, relatively few genes were significantly changed in HP1 mutant hippocampi. In examining such changes both a coarse analysis (Benjamin-Hochberg FDR &lt; 0.05) and a stringent analysis (FDR &lt; 0.01) was undertaken. To understand the primary effects the stringent analysis will first be discussed, followed by pathway analysis using the coarse analysis. Testing for significant changes between genotypes in the aged timepoint yields the heatmap seen in Figure 2.34A where data from young animals is included (Figure 2.34B. Notably, testing within batch for differential gene expression between WT and DKO genotypes in young animals largely gives the same gene set (data not shown), suggesting transcriptional differences are minimal between the 3 month DKO and the 13 month DKO. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes reveals distinct sets associated with genotype (Figure 2.34B). Clusters 1 &amp; 2 include genes that are underrepresented compared to WT. It is clear that cluster 1, which shows underrepresentation in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO and HP1DKO, comprises genes associated with the dentate gyrus, so their underrepresentation is not due to altered expression, rather a complete lack of the tissue that normally expresses them. Cluster 2 comprises a handful of genes that are in the vicinity of the HP1\\(\\gamma\\) gene locus, which infers their expression was affected due to local genomic changes following deletion of the HP1\\(\\gamma\\) gene. Genes and repeats in clusters 3, 4 and 5 have elevated expression compared to wildtype, due to either singular loss of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) (cluster 3), HP1\\(\\beta\\) (cluster 4) or both (cluster 5). Strikingly, from cluster 3 we can observe that the primary effect due to loss of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is elevated transcription of the protocadherin cluster on chromosome 18, which will be discussed later. Cluster 4 contains genes which are elevated in aged HP1\\(\\beta\\) animals and HP1DKO animals, one of which is the known imprinted gene Neuronatin ( Nnat ). Cluster 5 contains protein coding genes, lncRNAs and repeats which show elevated transcription only in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) double mutant and will be discussed in the next section. Figure 2.34: High Confidence Differential Gene Expression in HP1 Mutant Adult Hippocampi. Volcano plots (A) display log fold changes with respect to corrected p value (aged). (B) Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes (corrected p &lt; 0.01) across all samples. Read Coverage of lncRNAs Given the statistically significant de-repression of several lncRNAs, I looked at lncRNA read coverage across the entire genome in each of the mutants (Figure 2.35). Global de-repression of annotated long non-coding RNAs infers significant alterations to heterochromatin boundaries. Notably, transcription of lncRNAs increases steadily with age, in an effect that appears to be dependent on HP1\\(\\beta\\). Figure 2.35: LncRNA Transcription is Elevated in HP1 Mutants. Read coverage heatmaps of all lncRNAs genome-wide (bottom) plot all alignments per 50bp bin for each lncRNA locus including 1 kilobase upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and 1 kilobase downstream of the transcription end site (TES), which are scaled to be the same size. Read coverage profiles (top) profide an overview of genome-wide changes in lncRNA transcription. Read Coverage at Repeat Flanks A similar analysis was undertaken for LINE, SINE and LTR repeat classes (Figure 2.36). In the case of repeats, observing transcription at sequences that are upstream or downstream (ie sequences that ‘flank’ the repeat) can be informative for cases where the repeat cannot be mapped. From (Figure 2.36A), where the read coverage in repeat flanks is markedly higher than the internal repeat, we can assume that our measured counts of repeat transcripts are an underestimate of what is actually occurring in vivo. Significant de-repression of repeat type plotted by class (Figure 2.36B) reveals the most significant changes occur in the ERVK and ERV1 families. Figure 2.36: Read Coverage at Repeat Flanks in HP1 Mutants and Significant Changes by Repeat Class. (A) Read coverage profiles and heatmaps of LINE, SINE and LTR repeat classes. Repeats are scaled to be aligned by their 5’ end and their 3’ end in addition to 1kb upstream and downstream. (B) Significant changes in repeats by repeat familly. The most significant changes in HP1DKO belong to ERVK and ERV1 families. Chimeric Transcription Given the elevated transcription of ERV elements, I examined how this may contribute to chimeric transcription events-where transcription begins in a repeat-such as an LTR, and ‘reads into’ a coding gene or exon. The resultant transcript is a ‘chimera’ where it contains both the repeat and exon sequence. This may result in alternative splicing events or direct activation of entire genes. To find such transcripts I implemented a customized version of the LIONS pipeline (Babaian et al. 2018) to run on the BIH CUBI cluster. A strong trend can be observed in LTR-derived chimeric transcripts in DKO animals (Figure 2.37), where increased transcription of the repeat correlates with increased transcription of the adjacent exon. While most chimeric events are small, pertaining to exon inclusion or retention, elevated transcription in a subset of genes in Cluster 5 is due to direct activation by an adjacent repeat (Table 2.2 &amp; Figure 2.37).

(B) An example chimeric transcript. An IAP element inside the first intron of Mnd1 results in transcriptional activation of the entire gene. 2.8.2 Longitudinal Changes To Gene Expression Following initial data exploration, a non-negligible batch effect (see methods 6.1) dictated that it was unfavorable to conduct direct longitudinal comparisons of WT and DKO (Young WT vs Aged WT and Young DKO vs Aged DKO). However, testing for differential expression in HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) single mutants across age (within batch) yielded minimal results. For HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO for instance, no differential expression passes an FDR &lt; 0.01 or 0.05. For age-related changes in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO, no genes pass an FDR &lt; 0.01, and only a small number (184 genes) pass FDR &lt; 0.05. The top ten upregulated genes by ascending p value are presented in Table 2.3, with C4b being a notable top hit. The complete gene list of age-related expression changes in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO hippocampi is found in supplementary data 5.2.

Of the 184 genes differentially expressed in aged HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO hippocampi compared to their youthful counterparts, 43 genes (24%) are downregulated, such as Prox1 and others that may suggest a progressive loss of the dentate gyrus. The majority of changes lies in 141 genes (76%) which are upregulated. Upon testing for age-related changes to gene transcription in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO hippocampi, aged HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO cluster strongly with HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO samples (Figure 2.38, left). Following a reactome pathway analysis (https://reactome.org, Fabregat et al. (2018)) it became clear that the sustained absence of HP1\\(\\beta\\) results in cellular stress and immune responses akin to viral infection (Figure 2.38, right).

(Right): Top 25 rectome pathways from genes upregulated in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO across ages. To examine the cellular response to loss of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) and the de-repression of non-coding regions, the up-regulated gene set from the ‘coarse’ analysis (FDR &lt; 0.05) was analysed on reactome (Figure 2.39). Hierarchical clustering of the coarse set reveals that transcriptomic signatures of HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO hippocampi to be most similar to WT, excepting dysregulation of the protocadherin cluster (Figure 2.39, left). In HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO hippocampi, upregulated pathways comprise the unfolded protein response, innate immune responses including complement activation, neuromodulatory pathways such as dopamine and serotonin release, amongst other pathways important for synaptic function. It should be noted that protocadherins (Pcdhs) do not contribute to neurotransmitter pathway over-representation, as they are not presently annotated in reactome.org. If one compares genes differentially expressed in aged HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO with those changed in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO, a small subset of genes overlap which include complement components C4b and C1qa (Figure 2.40A). While Nnat is highly significant in the HP1DKO dataset, it narrowly fails FDR in the young vs aged HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO test statistic. C4 protein can be observed in CA3 cell bodies as well as GFAP-positive astrocytes in Aged HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO and HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO hippocampi (Figure 2.40B). Figure 2.40: (A) Intersection of Differential expression in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO and Aged HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO. (B) HP1\\(\\beta\\) Deficiency results in Elevated C4 Expression in CA3 Pyramidal Neurons The age-dependent upregulation of ncRNAs, repeats and ERVs in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO, coincides with pathway analysis that suggests an anti-viral response (Figure 2.38) is instigated following prolonged de-repression of endogenous retroviruses in the hippocampus. As ERV de-repression is even more robust in HP1DKO hippocampi, the 689 transcripts differentially regulated in HP1DKO were cross checked against the interferome database (http://www.interferome.org), where ~15% (88/565 protein coding genes) were found to overlap with cellular responses to interferons. Notably, the majority of the overlap (55) occurred from a previously published experiment where cortical neurons were treated with Interferon \\(\\beta\\) ( IFN\\(\\beta\\) ) and their transcriptome analysed. The immune response occurring in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO neurons involves upregulation of innate immunity related Oas3, Lyk6, Wdfy4, Zap70, Ly6e, Ctsz, Il34, Reep6, Crlf2, complement C3, C4b, C1qa, apoptosis-related Hrk and Aatk, interferon response genes Ifitm2, Ifi27, and the regulatory component of the Interferon gamma receptor, Ifngr2. The complete list of genes overlapping with the interferome is found in supplementary table ??.

Additionally, multiple genes normally attributed to chemotaxis/invasion ( Mmp14, Mmp17, Mpped1, Adam11, Cck) and phagocytosis ( Cd302 and the synapse-specific C1ql2) were differentially affected. This suggested that the end result of the inflammatory cascade could be resulting in the activation of microglia. Recent work has elucidated a role for microglia in synaptic pruning which appears to rely on complement proteins in the CNS (Stevens et al. 2007), and dysregulation of complement proteins is now understood to underlie a wide range of inflammatory diseases in the CNS including neurodegeneration (Bodea et al. 2014), Multiple sclerosis (Christensen et al. 2007), Alzheimer’s’ (Fischer et al. 1995), ALS (Lee et al. 2018), and normal aging (Stephan et al. 2013). The sustained elevated transcription of C3, C4 and C1qa in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO and HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO hippocampi is likely to result in increased infiltration and phagocytosis of neuronal synapses by microglia. This can be summarily seen in figure 2.41, where increased transcription of lncRNA and retroelements due to loss of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) has resulted in innate immune and unfolded protein responses. In the Stratum pyramidale where the CA3 cell bodies reside, an innate immune response has induced invasion of microglia while condensation of EIF3\\(\\eta\\)+ stress granules is visible in CA3 cell bodies, indicative of UPR activation there. All of the players in the aforementioned pathway have known links to inflammatory disease states, neurodegeneration, and normal aging. The potential causes of these cascades, along with their relevance to human aging and disease, will be examined in the next section. References "],

Emx1-mediated deletion of HPI\\(\\beta\\) impairs neurogenesis resulting in malformation of the infrapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus and a subsequent progressive reduction in the complexity of CA3 basal dendrites. This malformation of the dentate gyrus and reduction in CA3 basal dendrites is stronger in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO. At the molecular level, distinct and synergistic contributions of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) in mediating genome stability in neurons can be observed. In addition to detrimental effects on mitosis, deletion of HP1\\(\\beta\\) appears to affect tissue-specific imprinted loci in an age dependent manner. Deletion of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) in neurons results in complete loss of the histone post-translational modification H4K20me3 and up-regulation of the protocadherin cluster of genes on chromosome 18. Synergistic effects of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) include further activation of imprinted loci and de-repression of endogenous retroviruses and ncRNAs. Subsequently, this transcriptional de-regulation activates pathways associated with innate immunity and the unfolded protein response. Collectively, the effects described above contribute to cognitive effects that mirror aspects of human age-related cognitive decline. HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\)DKO mice display profound impairments in spatial memory which become progressively worse with age, in addition to age-dependent deficiencies in paired-pulse inhibition. HP1DKO mice also display cognitive deficits in nest construction, and show distinct abnormalities in circadian activity. The molecular mechanism(s) behind the multiple above phenotypes in addition to how they are connected is explored below. 3.1 Phenotypes Structural Changes in the Hippocampus Shortly after discovering strong de-repression of ERVs in HP1DKOs, we observed seizures in the colony. This provided the first pointer that functional changes were occuring in the hippocampus. How partial loss of the infrapyramidal blade (IFB) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO animals may have resulted in altered circuitry that favours seizure activity is unclear. It is possible that in the absence of the IFB, all inputs from the entorhinal cortex synapse on the suprapyramidal blade, which may render it hyper-excitable. However, it was unusual that the seizures occured more often in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO compared to DKO, which has a smaller DG and may have even higher convergence of entorhinal input. The degree of malformation of the IFB in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO and HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO correlates strongly with degree of age-dependent loss in CA3 basal dendrite complexity. Given proximal CA3 basal dendrites receive a large amount of input from the infrapyramidal blade, it is likely that CA3 basal dendrites remodel or degenerate based on this absence of input from the DG. The malformation of the dentate gyrus appears to be due to mitotic exhaustion as the number of Ki67+ cells in the developing DG is already reduced at P0 and progressively decreased at P8 (Figure 2.25). This corresponds with a reduction in the number of Prox1+ cells at P8, an effect that appears to be dependent on HP1\\(\\beta\\) and consistent with previous reports of mitotic deficits following its deletion (Aucott et al. 2008). Reduction in Cortical Volume While the total brain volume is noticibly reduced in young HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO animals, this difference fails to reach statistical significance in aged animals (Figure 2.26). Similarly, the raw volume of the young HP1DKO cortex is reduced, however if normalized to total brain volume, cortical volume is only significantly reduced in specific caudal regions (slices 3-5, 10-11 Figure 2.26). This selective reduction in cortical volume appears to be a developmental phenotype, as the aged HP1DKO cortex, while still smaller than WT, does not show region-specific reductions in cortical volume. Why such a rostral-caudal difference in cortical volume exists would require further analysis, but it may be related to the onset of Emx1 expression occuring slightly earlier in the caudal cortex (Theil et al. 1999), resulting in an earlier onset of HP1\\(\\beta\\)-related mitotic deficiencies in caudal neural progenitors. Behavior and Impairments in Learning &amp; Memory HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO mutants show several age-dependent behavioral abnormalities. The simplest test, where animal exploratory activity and anxiety is measured in an open field, reveals that aged HP1DKO mutants show extended initial freezing in the open field. For the first half of the open field test, aged HP1DKO animals show an absence of thigmotaxis –the tendency to remain close to the walls, and remain partially active in the centre zone for the first half of the test before further exploration (Figure 2.17). The prolonged activity of HP1DKO mutants in the centre of the open field occurs at the beginning of the test similar to in young HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO animals. Conversely, analysis of circadian activity reveals that HP1 double and single mutants are hyperactive compared to their wild-type brothers (Figure 2.18). Such increased activity is accompanied by increased bouts of grooming, and in aged HP1DKO animals increased bouts of eating (Figure 2.19), which may be indicative of increased anxiety and stress. HP1DKO animals also show pronounced deficits in the species-specific behavior of nest construction (Figure 2.21), which is thought to measure both animal wellbeing and cognitive function (Lin et al. 2007). As to be expected, the most prominent age-dependent behavioral phenotypes are those closely aligned with proper hippocampal function; namely Paired Pulse Inhibition (PPI) and spatial memory as measured in the Barnes Maze. Deficits in PPI appear to be unique to aged HP1DKO animals (Figure 2.20). Similar deficits in PPI in humans with dementia of Alzheimer’s type has been attributed to damage to the enthorhinal cortex and the loss of parahippocampal volume (Ueki et al. 2006; Kesslak, Nalcioglu, and Cotman 1991). As the entorhinal cortex is the source of the perforant path which projects to the DG, and the dentate gyrus projects to CA3 neurons, it is natural to infer deficits in PPI in HP1DKO aged animals is directly related to the age-dependent atrophy of CA3 basal dendrites (Figure 2.23F). The relationship between HP1 function and CA3 basal dendrite complexity is not a simple one. First, the complexity of CA3 basal dendrites in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO animals is half that of younger animals, yet the CA3 complexity in young HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO mice is reduced but does not change with age. Second, the spatial memory deficits seen in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO animals may be explained by DG malformation and reduced CA3 basal dendrite complexity but must be set against the observation that HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO exhibit similar structural malformations without any deficits in spatial memory (Figure 2.22). Lastly, HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO CA3 basal dendrite complexity shows a reduction with age, whereas the complexity of basal dendrites in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO neurons remains the same. It is thus more likely that the gross transcriptional dysregulation affects functional hippocampal output, either due to the observed altered transcription of neuromodulatory (such as dopamine &amp; serotonin) receptors (Figure 2.39 &amp; Supplementary Table 5.2) or potential synapse remodelling due to elevated levels of complement pathway components (Liddelow et al. 2017; Stevens et al. 2007). 3.2 HP1-dependent Epigenetic Systems The phenotypes observed due to HP1 deficiency do overlap partially with the phenotypes induced by deficiencies of related epigenetic pathways. HP1\\(\\gamma\\) A surprising finding was that the absence of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) alone could abolish all Histone 4 Lysine 20 trimethylation (H4K20me3) in Emx1Cre expressing cells. Even more surprising is that in both structural quantifications and behavioral tests, HP1\\(\\gamma\\) Emx1Cre mice are largely indistinguishable from wild-type. While one would expect H4K20me3 loss to be directly linked to ERV activation, HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO hippocampi only show elevated levels of MuRRS-int from the ERV1 family (section 2.8). The only notable change detected in HP1\\(\\gamma\\) Emx1Cre hippocampi is dysregulation of the protocadherin cluster of genes on chromosome 18. The protocadherin cluster contains three subclusters of protocadherins; \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\), which are arranged in tandem. \\(\\alpha\\)- and \\(\\gamma\\)- protocadherins are formed by variable first exons and a static C terminus, while \\(\\beta\\)-protocadherins are single exon genes. Their combinatorial assembly enables an immense range of unique surface molecules, enabling unique ‘barcoding’ of neurons, which is thought to be important for dendrite branching, synaptic connection, and neurite self-avoidance (Molumby et al. 2017; Rubinstein et al. 2015; Toyoda et al. 2014). Despite the previously ascribed importance of the \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) protocadherins in neuronal function, no pronounced differences could be observed in the morphological phenotyping or behavioral assays undertaken here. Figure 3.1: HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is Required for Transcriptional Regulation of the Protocadherin Cluster. (Top): Reference Gene annotation of the mouse protocadherin \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) clusters on chromosome 18 along with previously published ChIPseq of H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and H4K20me3 performed in cortical neurons. (Bottom): mRNA and LTR reference annotation along with RNA tracks from young and aged HP1 mutants. However, the HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO does provide a new insight into regulation of the protocadherin cluster. It has been previously reported that regulation of the protocadherin cluster is dependent on Wiz-mediated recruitment of G9a/GLP (Isbel et al. 2016) and H3K9 trimethylation by SETDB1 (Jiang et al. 2017). In humans, excessive H3K9me3 at the protocadherin cluster is associated with cognitive deficits in Kleefstra syndrome (Iacono et al. 2018). Additionally, altered DNA methylation at the protocadherin cluster is associated with several developmental and psychiatric diseases (El Hajj, Dittrich, and Haaf 2017). Age-dependent differences in DNA methylation have been observed at all \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) subclusters (Bell et al. 2012; El Hajj, Dittrich, and Haaf 2017; Salpea et al. 2012), however again these analyses could not distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC. Figure 3.2: H3K9me3 is unnaffected at the Protocadherin Cluster in HP1cTKO ES cells. While HP1cTKO ES cells show a loss of H3K9me3 at IAP elements proximal to the protocadherin cluster, H3K9me3 regulatory enrichment at the cluster is otherwise unaffected. H4K20me3 loss may cause the elevated transcription at the protocadherin cluster. H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 normally show parallel enrichment over the protocadherin cluster in cortical neurons (Figure 3.1). As H3K9me3 is considered a pre-requisite for H4K20me3 deposition (Kourmouli et al. 2004; Schotta 2004), it stands to reason that the function of SETDB1/H3K9me3-mediated transcriptional regulation of the protocadherin cluster (Jiang et al. 2017) functions by H4K20me3 deposition. This raises two possibilities; 1) that HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is required for SETDB1 localization, or that 2) elevated protocadherin transcription in HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO is due to the absence of H4K20me3. It is known that H4K20me3 could play a direct role in gene regulation. It has recently been reported that H4K20me3 is found to coincide with activating marks in ES cells (Xu and Kidder 2018), which may be in line with the known propensity of HP1\\(\\gamma\\) to associate with actively transcribed chromatin and its requirement for ES cell self-renewal (Caillier et al. 2010). In HP1cTKO embryonic stem cells, the binding profile of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 at the protocadherin cluster is slightly different from that in neurons. In neurons, where protocadherins are highly expressed, H4K20me3 strongly mirrors H3K9me3 signal (Figure 3.1). In ES cells, where protocadherins have very low expression, H4K20me3 primarily marks IAP elements within the protocadherin cluster (Figure 3.2). Importantly, H4K20me3 is lost in HP1cTKO ES cells while H3K9me3 appears unchanged (Figure 3.2). This indicates that contrary to the previous report that the protocadherin cluster is regulated by SETDB1 (Jiang et al. 2017), it is likely the loss of H4K20me3 (in both SETDB1 and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) mutants) that results in elevated transcription at the protocadherin cluster in neurons. HP1\\(\\beta\\) The stronger phenotypes observed are rooted in molecular mechanisms mediated by HP1\\(\\beta\\), which is consistent with its requisite roles in mitotic stability (Aucott et al. 2008), splicing (Yearim et al. 2015), DNA repair (Ayoub, Jeyasekharan, and Venkitaraman 2009; Trembecka-Lucas et al. 2013), and lethality (Billur, Bartunik, and Singh 2010). Notably, unbiased exome data predicts HP1\\(\\beta\\) to have the highest probability of loss of function intolerance (pLI) out of the HP1 proteins1. In HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flEmx1Cre animals, loss of HP1\\(\\beta\\) results in mitotic deficits of the dentate gyrus, described above, as well as numerous age-related changes that speak to its essential role in the stability of mammalian epigenetic systems that will be discussed below. Knockout studies of related epigenetic effectors show similar phenotypes to those seen in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flEmx1Cre animals. Previous work examining Dnmt1 loss in the brain, where Dnmt1 is deleted by tamoxifen induced Nestin-Cre, report a reduction in the formation of the dentate gyrus (Noguchi et al. 2016) similar to that seen here in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KOs. In the Dnmt1fl/flEmx1Cre mutant, robust activation of IAP elements phenocopies what occurs in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre mutant, however, the Dnmt1fl/flEmx1Cre mutant also displays a dramatic, progressive degeneration of the cortex (Hutnick et al. 2009) which is not seen in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flEmx1Cre or HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre brain. While there appears to be a tendency towards HP1\\(\\beta\\) being important in Dnmt1 function, given an age-dependent elevation of both repetitive elements, inflammatory C4 and C1qa and Nnat transcription in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flEmx1Cre brains, dysregulation of non-cannonical imprinted loci is most pronounced in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre mutants. HP1\\(\\beta\\) x HP1\\(\\gamma\\) Some of the strongest changes in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi occur at known imprinted loci such as Nnat (Evans 2005), Mkrn3 (Glenn et al. 1993), and non-cannonical loci such as Xlr3c and Xlr3a (Bonthuis et al. 2015). This effect is in line with the known role of HP1 proteins to stimulate Dnmt1 activity in vitro (Smallwood et al. 2007). However, the ~20 genes normally imprinted in mouse ( Plagl1, H19, Igfr2 etc.) appear to be unnaffected in the hippocampus. What can be observed is elevated transcription of non-cannonically imprinted genes that appear to be tissue-specific, Nnat, which is normally expressed in the CA3 region of the hippocampus (Oyang et al. 2011). A recent work, which restored Dnmt1 to Dnmt1 Null ESCs resulting in viable chimeras, identified 2468 No restored DMRs (NORED) regions; regions where Dnmt1-dependent methylation is not recovered once abolished (Martos et al. 2017). Tellingly, many genes changed in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi–including some of the strongest changes, are related to NORED regions. These include Oas3, Nnat, Xbp1, Got1l1, and Pcdha1, Pcdha2, Pcdha8, Pcdha11, Pcdhb9. Because Emx1Cre mediated excision of HP1 genes occurs from E10.5 onwards, it follows that the sustained absence of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is resulting in a loss of normal DNA maintenance methylation, and this may be the root cause of the majority of the genic and non-genic effects observed. Because the genes that are de-regulated are predominantly tissue-specific (ie. neuronal), it is likely that their de-repression is coupled with their initial transcription. This very phenomena has previously been observed with IAP elements in aging mice, where their periodic activation results in progressive demethylation and complete de-silencing (Barbot et al. 2002). The known role of DNA methylation in the regulation of the protocadherin cluster (Kaneko et al. 2009) means it is entirely possible that the loss of H4K20me3 in HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO is unrelated to their elevated transcription. In this scenario, despite recruitment of DNMT1 to the SETDB1/H3K9me3 complex, its enzymatic activity is not stimulated in the absence of HP1\\(\\gamma\\). As protocadherins are strongly expressed in neurons during their maturation, sustained transcriptional activation results in greater demethylation and subsequently, higher transcription. Concomitant to this is the fact that H4K20me3 is completely lost in the HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO but de-repression of repetitive elements is minimal. While it cannot be excluded that SETDB1/H3K9me3 distribution at the protocadherin locus is unaffected in HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO neurons, this is unlikely given H3K9me3 appears to be largely unaffected at Pcdh regulatory regions in HP1cTKO cells (Figure 3.2). Ultimately, why genic and non-genic regions normally regulated by DNA methylation are specifically affected in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO is unclear. The fact that the same effect is not observed in single mutants could make an argument for HP1 dosage, where the presence of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) alone is insufficient to stimulate Dnmt1-mediated maintenance methylation. However if this were true one would expect similar partial transcriptional dysregulation in HP1\\(\\beta\\)KO and HP1\\(\\gamma\\)KO single mutants, but this is not the case, as HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) are not entirely redundant in neurons. It is worth considering how the embryonic expression pattern of HP1\\(\\beta\\), HP1\\(\\gamma\\), and de-repressed IAP elements in the cortex may inform on the molecular mechanism. While HP1\\(\\gamma\\) is more ubiquitously expressed in the developing dorsal telencephalon (Figure 2.4), HP1\\(\\beta\\) is more robustly expressed in post-mitotic neurons, where repeats are exclusively de-repressed (Figure 2.11). This expression of repetitive elements in neurons of the cortical plate overlaps completely with the known wave of transcriptionally permissive 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC) that occurs upon cell cycle exit (Hahn et al. 2013). HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) no doubt have a major role in protecting repeat silencing during this wave of hydroxymethylation, as repeat activation is immediate in their absence. This may be related to HP1 proteins stimulating Dnmt1 activity via Uhrf1, as Uhrf1fl/flEmx1Cre mice show similar deficiencies in DNA methylation, upregulation of IAP elements, and increased 5hmC on IAP elements (Ramesh et al. 2016). HP1 proteins may be central to insulate repeats and imprinted loci from TET-mediated hydroxylation, as Uhrf1 binds 5mC and 5hmC with equal affinity (Frauer et al. 2011). How this occurs is yet to be determined, and remains a suitable course for future experiments. 3.3 Concordance with Aging and Disease The central question remains: how does heterochromatin loss and HP1\\(\\beta\\) &amp; HP1\\(\\gamma\\) deficiency contribute to disease states and normal aging in the human brain? Multiple studies have established that genetic associations for age-related traits may be mediated by DNA methylation (Bell et al. 2012; Horvath 2013; Verschoor et al. 2018). However, DNMT1fl/flEmx1Cre and Uhrf1fl/flEmx1Cre mutants show aggressive degenerative phenotypes which void their ability to model age-related changes in DNA methylation. Despite the minor malformation of the dentate gyrus, the HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre mutant is relatively stable, and provides a unique model to study both how heterochromatin loss may be a driver of aging and age-related disease risk, by affecting DNA methylation. Aging studies often attribute the loss of plasticity in aging hippocampi to a decreased splicing capacity (Stilling et al. 2014). Deficiency of HP1 proteins is known to negatively affect splicing by affecting DNA methylation of exons (Yearim et al. 2015), and while mRNA splicing was not explicitly analyzed here, it is likely that aberrations in mRNA splicing occur in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre mutants, and this further contributes to decreased neuronal function. What is clear, is that the primary changes in expression of genic and non genic entities in HP1DKO hippocampi is concordant with many effects seen during normal aging. The present study compared baseline adult mice (3 months) with older adult mice (13-14 months), however mice can live much longer, upwards of 24-29 months where the mouse is considered geriatric. The transcriptomes of cortex and hippocampi in these ‘geriatric’ mice show uncanny commonalities with HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi. They show downregulation of ZFP57 and SUV420H2, along with upregulation of much of the protocadherins (Sanchez et al. 2015). Some of the strongest changes in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre are also the strongest observed in very aged hippocampi. These include the upregulation of Pisd-ps1 and Pisd-ps2, two mysterious ncRNAs consistently observed with aging, and complement components C1qa, C3 and C4b (Sanchez et al. 2015; Stilling et al. 2014; Ianov et al. 2017; de Magalhães, Curado, and Church 2009) whose relevance will be discussed in the next section. Complement in CNS Aging and Disease Over the past decade new roles for the Complement system in the central nervous system (CNS) have been described, and are now understood to play pivotal roles in synaptic development, aging and neurodegenerative disease. Historically, Complement proteins were known for their role in the immune system in opsonizing (or ‘tagging’) pathogens for rapid elimination by phagocytic macrophages. During CNS development, Complement proteins are widely expressed in neurons and glia in the postnatal brain and are localized to synapses during the remodelling period, where microglia mediate synapse removal (Stevens et al. 2007). Since that time, dysregulation of Complement components in the CNS have become increasingly associated with disease states. Complement pathways have been observed to be reactivated in depression (Wei et al. 2017), Huntington’s disease (Singhrao et al. 1999), ALS (Lee et al. 2018), Alzheimer’s disease (Fischer et al. 1995; Lian et al. 2015; Hong et al. 2016; Trouw et al. 2008), tauopathies (Sharma et al. 2018), and over the course of normal aging (Stephan et al. 2013; de Magalhães, Curado, and Church 2009). In Alzheimer’s disease, microglial activation coincides with an increase in complement C1q and resulting synapse loss that precedes plaque pathology in the hippocampus (Hong et al. 2016). Additionally, intragenic duplication of complement receptor 1 ( CR1 ) is known to be one of the most potent risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (Lambert et al. 2013; Kucukkilic et al. 2018). Similarly, variation at the C4b locus serves as a potent risk factor for schizophrenia (Sekar et al. 2016; Nimgaonkar et al. 2017). Normal aging is associated with a dramatic increase in C1q in the brain (Stephan et al. 2013), which in addition to its inflammatory roles, may promote aging -related phenotypes by activation of the Wnt pathway (Naito et al. 2012). How astrocytes and microglia coordinate the complement cascade is not fully understood, but it has been suggested that activated microglia induce A1-like reactive astrocytes by secreting TNF\\(\\alpha\\), Il-1\\(\\alpha\\) and C1q (Liddelow et al. 2017). Subsequently, as normal aging induces activated microglia (Norden and Godbout 2013), this in turn induces chronic A1 astrocyte reactivity which is detrimental to neuronal function (Clarke et al. 2018). Complement activation in the aging brain may have as many triggers as there are pathways to inflammation. What the present study indicates is that the primary inducer of age-related increases in complement cascades may be of endogenous origin, namely the activation of an innate immune response via by endogenous retroviruses. A Pathway to Complement How heterochromatin loss results in complement activation is likely to operate by an initial innate immune response to elevated ERV transcripts. This is likely initiated by a member of the RIG-1 family of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as RIG-1 (Retinoic-acid Inducible Gene 1, official gene name DDX58) or MDA5 (Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5, official gene name IFIH1). RIG-1 and MDA5 have been observed to recognize dsRNA from exogenous and endogenous viruses and initiate immune responses by associating with the Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), which induces an inflammatory response by signalling via IRF3 or IRF7 (Interferon regulatory factor 3 or 7 respectively) (Cuellar et al. 2017; Loo et al. 2008; Dai et al. 2018). This innate immune response to ERVs has been elucidated in several cancer studies. For example, treatment with drugs that inhibit DNA methylation (DNMTi) results in de-repression of endogenous retroviruses and activation of an interferon response via MDA5/MAVS/IRF7 (Chiappinelli et al. 2015; Roulois et al. 2015). In another case SETDB1 is found upregulated in a number of cancers, and upon deletion of SETDB1, elevated transcripts of dsRNAs derived from retrotransposons induce an interferon response via RIG-1/MDA5/MAVS/IRF7 (Cuellar et al. 2017). HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi show various signatures of activation of this innate immune pathway and is represented in Figure 3.3. They show elevated transcription of WDFY4, which is known to augment MDA5 signalling (Kochi et al. 2018). Activation of the MDA5/MAVS/IRF3/7 pathway stimulates expression of 2’-5’-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 3 ( OAS3 , also strongly upregulated in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi) (Rutherford, Hannigan, and Williams 1988) whose expression controls the activity of RNase L (Li et al. 2016). Upon contact with dsRNA, OAS3 produces 2’,5’-oligoadenylate (2-5A) (Kristiansen et al. 2011), a molecule required for the activity of RNase L. Once activated, RNase L is able to digest dsRNA in the cytoplasm. It is difficult to pinpoint the interferon pathway from transcriptome data, as induced genes from type I and type II interferon (IFN) can be largely redundant (Crotta et al. 2013). In HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi the initial innate immune response due to ERV activation appears to be related to IFN-\\(\\gamma\\). IFN-\\(\\gamma\\) is the key regulator of macrophage activation via the JAK/STAT pathway (Cherwinski et al. 1987) and its regulation is dependent on assembly of its receptor, comprised of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. The upregulation of IFNGR2 in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO hippocampi is a strong indication of IFN-\\(\\gamma\\) pathway activation, as IFNGR1 is normally produced in excess, and IFNGR2 is more tightly regulated in most cell types (Bernabei et al. 2001; Regis et al. 2006), such that its surface expression dictates responsiveness to IFN-\\(\\gamma\\) (Bach et al. 1995). In multiple sclerosis, a disease where human ERVs are suspect, surface localization of IFNGR2 in T cells has been shown to be dependent on JAK2, and that this pathway is required for IFN-\\(\\beta\\) -based therapy to be effective (Conti et al. 2012). In otherwords, elevated expression of IFNGR2 makes cells sensitive to both IFN-\\(\\gamma\\) (type II) and IFN\\(\\beta\\) (type I) signalling. Activated astrocytes in many neurodegenerative diseases show upregulation of IFNGRs (Hashioka et al. 2009), suggesting increased sensitivity to IFN-\\(\\gamma\\) signalling. Once effected, IFN-\\(\\gamma\\) signalling has been found to up-regulate expression of the complement components C3 and C4 by stabilization of their mRNA (Mitchell et al. 1996), an effect that has been observed in the brain (Chakrabarty et al. 2010). Notably, in addition to being described in several other non-inflammatory roles, IFN\\(\\gamma\\) signalling has been shown to promote tau hyperphosphorylation (A. Li et al. 2015), a feature commonly observed in Alzheimer’s Disease. Figure 3.3: Heterochromatin Loss Results in De-repression of ERVs and Activaton of Innate Immune Pathways and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). (A): Deficiency of HP1 proteins results in loss of DNA methylation at tissue specific Differentially Methylated Regions (tDMRs) and Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs). (B): De-repressed ERVs are (1) detected in the cytoplasm by MDA5/RIG-1, which (2) signals via MAVS to (3a) activate IRF3/7 to induce 4) interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in the nucleus, such as OAS3 and IFNGR2. OAS3 bound to dsRNA produces 2’,5’-oligoadenylate (2-5A), which activates RNase L to digest dsRNA. Upregulation of IFNGR2 sensitizes the cell to IFN\\(\\gamma\\) signalling, which is known to stabilize C3 and C4b mRNAs. (3b) Activation of PKR results in phosphorylation of eIF2\\(\\alpha\\), which results in translation of ATF4, further inducing unfolded protein response genes (UPRGs) (5). All induced genes marked with green upward arrows show upregulation in HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO hippocampi. Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) Major neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson’s (PD), Huntington’s (HT), frontotemporal dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins or protein aggregates. Notable players in the HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre unfolded protein response include elevated transcription of ATF5, Pdia6, and XBP1. Several XBP1 target genes are also upregulated, such as WFS1 and Creb3l1 a gene whose function has already been implicated in dendrite loss (Chung et al. 2017). Because extensive cross-talk is known to occur between innate immune pathways and the unfolded protein response (Smith 2014), UPR activation in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi is inseparable from ERV de-repression. Despite the demonstrated synergies between innate immune and UPR pathways, how UPR machinery becomes active after induction by the RIG-1/MDA5 remains unclear. Cross-talk occurs between innate immune responses but appears to be selective. For instance, it was observed that toll-like-receptor (TLR) activation can induce XBP1 transcription to activate UPR in macrophages, but this occurs only during engagement of TLR2 and 4, and not TLR3,7 or 9 (Martinon et al. 2010). Furthermore it was found that engagement of the UPR response (in the form of spliced XBP1) was required for optimal TLR stimulated induction of cytokines and inflammatory mediators (Martinon et al. 2010). Other arms of the UPR response tend to be as equally important in initiating an immune response, as deficiency of GADD34 ( PRR1R15A , a UPR gene) severely impairs IFN-\\(\\beta\\) response to virus, which was thought to act in parallel with MDA5 pathway for dsRNA sensing (Clavarino et al. 17AD–2012). Many exogenous viruses are known to activate the unfolded protein response, such as Hepatitis B (Pager et al. 2013; Mastroeni et al. 2018), West Nile (Medigeshi et al. 2007), Dengue (Umareddy et al. 2007), respiratory syncytial virus (Cervantes-Ortiz, Zamorano Cuervo, and Grandvaux 2016), and Zika (Gladwyn-Ng et al. 2018). Many other viruses act by modulating the UPR response for their benefit, such as hepatitis C (Ke and Chen 2011, Tardif et al. (2004)). Recently, many endogenous repetitive elements have been observed in stress granules, such as Alu (Fitzpatrick and Huang 2012), and the LINE1 open reading frame (Goodier et al. 2007). In pro-B cells, deletion of SETDB1 resulted in de-repression of ERVs and a transcriptional profile indicating a similar unfolded protein response (Pasquarella et al. 2016). Given induction of innate immunity to ERVs via MAVS at the mitochondrial membrane, it is likely that in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi, UPR signaling originates there. This is also concordant with HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi showing elevated transcription of ATF5, a transcription factor associated with the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). UPR originating from MAVS is suspected to involve MAVS-mediated activation of protein kinase R (PKR), although the mechanism is unknown. An alternative is that PKR is activated by IFN\\(\\gamma\\) mRNA (Ben-Asouli et al. 2002) or directly by ERV dsRNA (Lemaire et al. 2008; Williams 1999). Once activated, PKR phosphorylates c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK2, which activates c-Jun, initiating a nuclear transcriptional response (Rath et al. 2012). In terms of classical UPR pathways, activated PKR can directly phosphorylate eIF2\\(\\alpha\\) (Rojas, Arias, and L’opez 2010). Once phosphorylated, eIF2\\(\\alpha\\) initates a repression of global translation initiation along with a selective enhancement of ATF4 translation (Vattem and Wek 2004), which then initiates transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus (Figure 3.3). Elevated levels of Neuronatin ( Nnat ) is also likely to contribute to the unfolded protein response. Strongly expressed in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, neuronatin is a proteolipid, a class of proteins normally found as subunits of membrane channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which facilitate calcium influx during the normal folding and assembly of proteins. Neuronatin also has proven functions for simulating the release of calcium ions in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons, a process which is necessary for in-situ translation (Oyang et al. 2011). Neuronatin is notably aggregate prone, as evidenced in patients with Lafora disease. Under normal physiological conditions, neuronatin is marked for degradation by the E3-Ubiquitin ligase malin. In Lafora disease, a mutation in the malin gene results in the accumulation of cytotoxic misfolded neuronatin aggregates which disrupt the endoplasmic reticulum (Sharma et al. 2013). Thus, loss of imprinting and bi-allelic expression of Neuronatin due to heterochromatin loss marks it as an important risk factor in age-related diseases of the hippocampus. Viruses, Transactivation and Neurodegeneration Given the anti-viral inflammatory responses observed following loss of repeat silencing in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi, it is natural to draw parallels to exogenous viral infections of the brain. Indeed, a recent study found that exogenous infection by west nile virus phenocopies what occurs in HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/flHP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/flEmx1Cre hippocampi, where synapse loss in the CA3 region of the hippocampus occurs via the activation of complement (Vasek et al. 2016). In fact, evidence is mounting to implicate infection with comon exogenous viruses to be causative in several neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), evidence for exogenous infection was first put forward in 1991 where a low-throughput study found that brains from AD patients contain Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) DNA (Jamieson et al. 1991). By 2016, over 100 publications have supported either direct or indirect associations making HSV1 the pathogen most strongly linked to AD (Itzhaki et al. 2016). HSV1 DNA has been found to be localized to amyloid plaques (Wozniak, Mee, and Itzhaki 2009), and it has recently been understood that following HSV1 or HHV-6A infection, amyloid-\\(\\beta\\) (A\\(\\beta\\)) is rapidly induced to surround and contain viral DNA (Eimer et al. 2018). Recent sequencing experiments have profiled viral content in the aging brain and have found that many common viral species are frequently observed in the normal aging brain, but that elevated levels of human herpesvirus 6A and 7 (HHV-6A and HHV-7) was unique to Alzheimer’s brains (Readhead et al. 2018). The same study found that HHV-6A interacts directly or indirectly with most of the known Alzheimer’s disease risk genes. Furthermore, a sixteen-year clinical study in 33,448 patients found that HSV increases the risk of AD 2.5-fold and that antiviral medication could drastically reduce risk ten-fold (Tzeng et al. 2018). Finally, the fact that AD brain homogenates injected into healthy primates can induce AD pathology (Baker et al. 1994; Ridley et al. 2006) speaks to an infectious origin. Aside from the negative effects of acute inflammatory response from exogenous viral infection, the greater consequence is how a lifetime of viral infection can affect the epigenome. Infection from common viruses such as HSV and even influenza are known to induce the expression of human endogenous retroviruses (Nellåker et al. 2006), a process termed viral transactivation. This particular phenomena has strong links to the inducement of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), where both HSV and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) have been linked to activation of human endogenous retrovirus W (HERV-W) and subsequent activation of the immune system (Brudek et al. 2008; Mameli et al. 2013; Mameli et al. 2012). The activation of endogenous retroelements can also be driven by pharmacological agents and disease genes. As mentioned above, cancer studies have shown that ERVs can be de-repressed by drugs such as DNMT inhibitors. Other drugs such as Chloroquine, which is normally used to treat malaria, has been found to trigger EBV replication by phosphorylation of KAP1 (Li, Burton, and Bhaduri-McIntosh 2017), which is then likely to have knock-on effects by transactivating HERVs. Several disease-risk genes are implicated in direct ERV activation, such as TDP-43 in ALS or tau-mediated chromatin relaxation in Alzheimer’s (section 1.3.2). Other risk genes may act more indirectly, such as \\(\\alpha\\)-synuclein (AD, PD, Lewy-body dementia) which has been found to sequester DNMT1 from the nucleus (Desplats et al. 2011). Ultimately, our understanding of how various pharmacological and genetic interventions affect ERV activation is currently very limited. If the multiscale HSV AD study was any indication, it appears that a large majority of genes associated with neurodegenerative disease risk have essential roles in either perturbing heterochromatin stability, innate immunity, or ERV activation –pathways now understood to be intrinsically linked. 3.4 Concluding Remarks The present study is the first to establish an uninterrupted link between heterochromatin loss, de-repression of endogenous retroviruses, and activation of immune and complement pathways resulting in decreased neuronal complexity and accelerated cognitive decline. Whats more, the concordance of the phenotype observed here with established features of normal aging and neurodegenerative disease further substantiates the heterochromatin loss model of aging. It is worth considering that in addition to a great diversity of cell subtypes and gene programs, neurons have exapted several epigenetic features that appear to enable their function during excitation at the cost of genomic stability: From DNA repair neurons have exapted activity-dependent DNA double-strand breaks for immediate-early gene activation (Madabhushi et al. 2015; Madabhushi, Pan, and Tsai 2014). From mitosis they have exapted the phosphorylation of H3S10, which ejects HP1 from H3K9me3-chromatin during periods of excitation (Noh et al. 2014). From the DNA methylation cycle neurons have exapted high levels of 5hmC, perhaps to enable rapid transcription to facilitate plasticity (Szulwach et al. 2011). All of the above, which no doubt enable neurons to act as they do, also expose the genome to risk in the form of recombination, repeat activation or any combination of the two (Newman et al. 2017). While the possibility may exist to waylay neuronal aging by halting viral transactivation, the intrinsic properties of neurons may align with universal rules; just as one cannot choose both speed and stability, perhaps one cannot choose both function and longevity.

HP1 mouse lines (HP1\\(\\alpha\\)KO, HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T, HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/fl, HP1\\(\\gamma\\)fl/fl) were cloned by Dr. Jeremy Brown. The Emx1Cre mouse was obtained from the Jackson laboratory (http://www.jax.org/). 4.1 Mouse Lines The Heterochromatin Protein 1 Floxed Emx1Cre (HP1FEC) mouse line was generated by combining mouse lines containing floxed alleles of HP1\\(\\beta\\) (Cbx1, chromosome 11) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) (Cbx3, chromosome 6) with the Emx1-IRES-Cre mouse line, which drives cre-mediated recombination in pyramidal neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus (Gorski et al. 2002). In this animal, the presence of the Cre transgene will induce excision of any and all floxed HP1 alleles in Emx1+ neuronal progenitors around E10.5. Initially, HP1\\(\\alpha\\) (Cbx5, chromosome 15) was also intended to be deleted, which was accomplished by crossing with an HP1\\(\\alpha\\) KO animal. However, as previously described, the HP1\\(\\alpha\\) KO allele was able to express using an alternate ATG start, and generated the truncated ‘HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T’, which we found to be infertile. 4.1.1 Generation of HP1\\(\\alpha\\)KO and HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T Figure 4.1: Genetic Design for Generation of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) Null Mutation The strategy to generate an HP1\\(\\alpha\\) null allele involved using a targeting cassette that inserts a STOP cassette preceding the canonical ATG of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) in addition to a cryptic ATG (Figure 4.1. Targetting cassettes were introduced into ES cells by homologous recombination. Successful integration was detected by neomycin selection. Following insertion of the targeting casette (NeO allele of Figure 4.1) all transcription of HP1\\(\\alpha\\) is halted, resulting in complete absence of the protein (HP1\\(\\alpha\\)KO). This design was to enable conditional reconstitution of the HP1\\(\\alpha\\) allele, where addition of Cre to the NeO allele induces recombination at loxP sites, removing the NeO STOP cassette, and transcription is allowed to proceed (FLPe Allele, Figure 4.1). The FLPe allele was not used in these studies. Crossing the FLPe allele with a flip deleter mouse results in flippase-mediated recombination at FRT sites, which was intended to remove all transcription start sites to give an HP1\\(\\alpha\\) null allele, but in fact resulted in HP1\\(\\alpha\\)T via downstream transcription start sites inside exon III (see Results 2.1). 4.1.2 Generation of Floxed HP1\\(\\beta\\) &amp; Floxed HP1\\(\\gamma\\) Figure 4.2: Genetic Design for Generation of Floxed HP1\\(\\beta\\) Allele The targeting of HP1\\(\\beta\\) (Figure 4.2) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) (Figure 4.3) used a similar strategy. This involved introduction of a targeting cassette into ES cells by homologous recombination that inserted loxP sites surrounding exons II and III. Succesfful integrations were detected by neomycin selection via an FRT flanked neomycin cassette inserted between exons III and IV (NeO allele, Figure 4.2 &amp; 4.3). Following crossing to a flip-deleter mouse, the NeO cassette is removed by flippase-mediated recombination, giving the conditional (HP1\\(\\beta\\)fl/fl) allele. In the presence of cre recombinase (either by ectopic expression or by crossing with a cre mouse such as Emx1Cre), recombination occurs at loxP sites, resuting in excision of exons II and III and loss of expression (Cre allele, Figure 4.2 &amp; 4.3). Figure 4.3: Genetic Design for Generation of Floxed HP1\\(\\gamma\\) Allele 4.1.3 Genotyping DNA Isolation For Genotyping, a simple ispropropanol DNA isolation protocol was utilized. This involved mixing 0.3 cm tailcuts or earcuts in 1.5ml tubes with 300 \\(\\mu\\)l of lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS) each supplemented with 6 \\(\\mu\\)l Proteinase K (10 mg/ml). Lysis proceeded on a heatblock shaker and lysed at 55\\(^\\circ\\)C for a minimum of 2hrs. Following lysis, tubes were centrifuged at 13,000rpm on a tabletop centrifuge for 2 minutes to pellet hair and unlysed debris. The supernatant was then moved to a new tube where it was mixed with an equal volume (300 \\(\\mu\\)l) of 100% isopropanol to precipitate the DNA. Following thorough mixing, DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 13000rpm for 15mins. The supernatant was then discarded and the DNA pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol, spinning down for 5 minutes at 13,000rpm between washes. Following removal of the final ethanol wash, the DNA pellet is allowed to air-dry. DNA is then resuspended in 50 \\(\\mu\\)l of ddH2O. Genotyping was then perfomed using GoTaq Polymerase (Promega) using the appropriate primers listed in table 4.1 in a multiple of the following reaction: (For five 20 \\(\\mu\\)l reactions) 20 \\(\\mu\\)l 5X GoTaq Buffer 2 \\(\\mu\\)l dNTPs (10 mM) X \\(\\mu\\)l Forward Primer (10 \\(\\mu\\)M) (depending on the PCR) X \\(\\mu\\)l Reverse Primer (10 \\(\\mu\\)M) (depending on the PCR) 1 \\(\\mu\\)l genomic DNA 0.5 \\(\\mu\\)l GoTaq Polymerase ddH20 (to 100 \\(\\mu\\)l) Table 4.1: HP1FEC Genotyping Primers and PCR Programs PCR Primers Program Amplicons HP1\\(\\alpha\\) 18319: gacagccaaggctacacag 95\\(^\\circ\\)C 1’ KO: 347b.p. 23267: ggtgttggacaggcgcatgg 95\\(^\\circ\\)C 60’’ — WT: 450b.p. 22436: cccaagcagagtcagtctca 62\\(^\\circ\\)C 30’’ x39 72\\(^\\circ\\)C 45’’ — 72\\(^\\circ\\)C 1’ 12\\(^\\circ\\)C HP1\\(\\beta\\) 22427: gagtacgaactaccatactggac 95\\(^\\circ\\)C 1’ Targeted: 500b.p.

Wayne Davis; http://biologylabs.utah.edu/jorgensen/wayned/ape/) or Snapgene Viewer (GSL biotech; http://www.snapgene.com/products/snapgene_viewer/). 4.2.1 RNA Isolation, cDNA Generation, &amp; RNAseq RNA Isolation RNA was isolated from E17, P0 and adult C57BL/6J mouse cerebral cortex using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, this involved homogenizing cortices in 500 \\(\\mu\\)l TRIzol using a tissue homogenizer, adding 100 \\(\\mu\\)l 100% chloroform, shaking vigorously for 15 seconds, and allowing to incubate 5 mins RT. Following a second thorough mixing, the homogenate was then spun for 15 minutes at 13,000rpm, 4\\(^\\circ\\)C on a tabletop centrifuge to allow phase separation. The upper aqueous phase (~200 \\(\\mu\\)l) was moved to a new tube, and 250 \\(\\mu\\)l of isoporpoanol was added to precipitate RNA at -20\\(^\\circ\\)C for 1 hour. Precipitaed RNA was then pelleted by spinning for 10 minutes at 13,000rpm, 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. Supernatant was decanted and RNA pellet was washed once with 75% ethanol (molecular grade ethanol, diluted with RNase-free ddH20. Following removal of the ethanol wash, RNA pellet was allowed to air dry for 15 minutes and resuspended in 50 \\(\\mu\\)l of RNase-free water and 1 \\(\\mu\\)l RNAsin RNase inhibitor (Promega). For RNAseq, RNA was isolated using the Relia-prep RNA mini kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA Library Generation cDNA was generated from the obtained RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (ThermoFischer). Briefly, 5 \\(\\mu\\)g of purified total RNA was mixed with 250 ng of random primers and 1 \\(\\mu\\)l of 10 mM dNTP mix, and the final volume brought to 12 \\(\\mu\\)l with RNAase-free water. Mixture was then heated to 65\\(^\\circ\\)C for 5 min and quickly chilled on ice. 4 \\(\\mu\\)l of 5X First-Strand Buffer was then added alongside 2 \\(\\mu\\)l 0.1 M DTT, and incubated at 25\\(^\\circ\\)C for 2 minutes. To begin the reverse transcription reaction, 1 \\(\\mu\\)l of SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase was added, mixed by pipetting, and the final volume was brought to 20 \\(\\mu\\)l with RNase-free water. Because random primers were used, the reaction was incubated at 25\\(^\\circ\\)C for 10 minutes, and then 42\\(^\\circ\\)C for 50 minutes. Reaction was inactivated by heating at 70\\(^\\circ\\)C for 15 minutes. 4.2.2 Cloning of RNA Probes for In-Situ Hybridization Probe Design For genic probes, gene coding sequence was obtained from the UCSC gene sorter and submitted to NCBI’s mouse-specific BLAST to confirm unique transcript regions. A unique ~1,000 bp region was selected to generate an amplicon of 600-900 bp. Primers for this amplicon were designed by submitting the unique region to Primer3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3) and specifying the size range of 600-900 bp. Primers were typically designed to anneal around 58\\(^\\circ\\)C. For non-genic probes, primers were designed around consensus sequences obtained from RepBase. Potential amplicons were then queried using UCSC’s BLAT or NCBI BLAST to determine the estimated diversity of transcripts corresponding to the probe. A probe unique for an IAP element on chromosome 2 was inferred from searching (UCSC in silico PCR) the location of previously used qPCR primers (Julie Brind’Amour, UBC). Primers used to clone in situ probes are listed in table 4.2. Probe PCR &amp; Vector Ligation Probe templates were generated by amplifying from cDNA libraries using GoTaq polymerase in the following reaction: 10 \\(\\mu\\)l 5X GoTaq Buffer 1 \\(\\mu\\)l dNTPs (10 mM) 1 \\(\\mu\\)l Forward Primer (10 \\(\\mu\\)M) 1 \\(\\mu\\)l Reverse Primer (10 \\(\\mu\\)M) 1 \\(\\mu\\)l cDNA 0.5 \\(\\mu\\)l GoTaq Polymerase 35.5 \\(\\mu\\)l ddH20 (to 50 \\(\\mu\\)l) PCR Program: Temperature Duration Step 95\\(^\\circ\\)C 1 minute initial denaturation 95\\(^\\circ\\)C 30 seconds denaturation — 58\\(^\\circ\\)C 30 seconds annealing x39 Cycles 72\\(^\\circ\\)C 45 seconds elongation — 72\\(^\\circ\\)C 1 minute final elongation 20\\(^\\circ\\)C END PCR amplicons were then directly loaded into a 1.5% agarose gel cast with TAE buffer (40mM Tris, 20mM acetic acid, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and run at 150mV. Amplicons were gel-extracted using a QIAquick Gel extraction Kit (QIAGEN). Purified amplicon DNA was then ligated overnight at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C into the pGEMT easy vector (Promega) using T4 ligase in the following reaction: 2 \\(\\mu\\)l 10X Rapid Ligation Buffer 8 \\(\\mu\\)l Gel Extracted PCR Product 0.5 \\(\\mu\\)l pGEMT vector 1 \\(\\mu\\)l T4 Ligase 9.5 \\(\\mu\\)l H2O ———————————– 20 \\(\\mu\\)l Total Table 4.2: Primers used for In Situ Probes Probe Primer Sequence IAP chr2 unique fw: CCAGCGGTGACCACTTAGA rv: AAGACAACACAGAGCCTCCT IAP consensus fw: ATGTGCCGAGGGTGGTTCTT rv: TGAATCCTTCTTAACAGTCTGCT MERVL consensus fw: CTTCCATTCACAGCTGCGACTG rv: TTTCCACAGATACTAAGAGCAGC LINE1 ORF2 fw: CAAGATCCAACACCCATTCATGA rv: TTCCGCCAGAAGTTCTTTTATCC Impact fw: TTTATGGCGAGGAGTGGTGT rv: TCTCACACAGGTTCACGTCTTA Inpp5f fw: TGGGTAATAAGGTCCAGGGG rv: GGGTTCTGCTGGACTCTTCT Gnas fw: ATGGATCGCAGGTCCCGG rv: TTAGTGACGCCGGATGGG Grb10 fw: TACCATGCCAAGTGAGAGCA rv: CGCCTTTGGATTACTCTGGC Mdga1 fw: CAGTACCACCCACCATCAGT rv: TTGTGCTGGTTCAACTGTCG Pip5k1c fw: TGCACAACATCGATCAGCAG rv: GGCAGCGTCTATTTCCACAG Rasgrf1 fw: ATCGTGTGCTGAATGTGCTC rv: TAGTCTGCTGAAACTGGCGA Plagl1 fw: ACCCACGATCCCAACAAGAT rv: GAGGAGAGGTGGGAACTACG 4.2.3 Cloning of Expression Constructs To clone HP1 and SUV420H2 constructs, two rounds of PCR were conducted. Primers used for clonding of expression constructs are listed in table 4.3. The first round involved amplifying the ‘naked’ coding region of the gene, which utilized *_110 and *_111 primers. After succesful cloning of ‘naked’ inserts into pGEMT plasmids, these plasmids were then used as templates in a second PCR reaction, using primers containing restriction sites suitable for ligation into fusion constructs. In the case of SUV420H2, the second round of PCR added a C-terminal myc tag.

PCR amplicons were then gel-extracted and A-tailed (GoTaq &amp; 1 \\(\\mu\\)M dNTPs in GoTaq buffer, 72\\(^\\circ\\)C for 1 hour) prior to overnight ligation into pGEMT backbone (as described above) yielding pGEMT-HP1x (where x is \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), or \\(\\gamma\\)). To generate eGFP fusions, HP1 coding sequences were re-amplified using the second set of primers which remove the stop codon and add KpnI and AgeI restriction sites. These amplicons were then A-tailed and ligated into pGEMT backbones yielding pGEMT-kpnI-HP1x. To create pCAG-HP1x-eGFP fusion constructs, pGEMT-kpnI-HP1x plasmids and pCAG-eGFP (Clontech) were digested with KpnI and AgeI for 4 hours at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C, and purified by gel extraction. HP1 inserts were then ligated into pCAG-eGFP overnight at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C using T4 ligase as described above, which yielded pCAG-HP1x-eGFP fusion constructs. Prior to cloning SUV420H2, pCAG-mycDKK was created by substituting the CAG promoter from pCAG-eGFP with the CMV promoter of pCMV6-Entry though double digestion with SpeI and EcoRI. To clone SUV420H2, a ‘naked’ SUV420H2 amplicon was first amplified using 110 and 111 primers. Then , 1 \\(\\mu\\)l of this PCR product was used as a template in a second PCR using KpnI and XhoI primers. The PCR product from KpnI and XhoI primers was then gel-extracted and digested for 20 minutes using Fast Digest KpnI and XhoI (Fermentas). This digested product was then ligated to a KpnI XhoI digested pCAG-mycDKK vector, resulting in an in-frame C-terminal myc-DKK (Myc tag and Flag tag). 4.2.4 Site Directed Mutagenesis For SUV420H2 IP experiments, mutations were designed in chromoshadow domain (CSD) of HP1\\(\\gamma\\). The created CSD mutations are summarized in table 4.4. All HP1 point mutations were created using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis protocol (New England Biolabs). This involved designing primers using the online NEBaseChanger tool (http://nebasechanger.neb.com), using pGEMT-kpnI-HP1x plasmids as templates.

Notably, the duration of the elongation step of each PCR program was sufficient to amplify the length of the entire plasmid. Following 25 cycles of PCR, 5 \\(\\mu\\)l of product was run on a gel to check for a successful PCR, which should yield a linear product the length of the entire plasmid.

After sequence verification, mutated HP1 inserts were digested from pGEMT using KpnI and AgeI and ligated into pCAG-eGFP, yielding HP1 point mutant-GFP fusions in pCAG-HP1x(mut)-eGFP. 4.2.5 Transformation For pGEMT-ligations, prior to transformations, ampicilin (100 \\(\\mu\\)g/ml) agar plates were coated with 40 \\(\\mu\\)l XGal (40 mg/ml in DMF) and 40 \\(\\mu\\)l Isopropyl \\(\\beta\\)-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 100 mM) to allow for blue/white selection. Plates were then warmed at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C for 15 minutes to ensure evaporation of DMSO. Ligations were transformed into XL10-Gold heat-competent e.coli by thawing 50 \\(\\mu\\)l cells on ice for 10 minutes and adding 5 \\(\\mu\\)l of ligation mixture to the cells and applying a heat shock of 42\\(^\\circ\\)C for 45 seconds before returning to ice. After a 5 minute incubation on ice, 500 \\(\\mu\\)l of Lysogeny Broth (LB) transformation mixture was added and ligation was shaken vigorously for 15 minutes at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C before plating. Plates where then incubated overnight at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C. 4.2.6 Clonal Selection &amp; Plasmid Production Following transforamtion, single colonies were picked and grown as minipreps in 4 ml LB + ampicilin (100 \\(\\mu\\)g/ml) overnight. Typically 3 colonies are sufficient to find a positive clone. The following day plasmid DNA was purified from miniprep cultures by using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following test digestions to determine the orientation of the insert, clones were sequenced to confirm template sequence fidelity. For expression constructs, clones deemed desirable were then re-transformed and grown in 200 ml of LB and purfied using endotoxin-free maxiprep kit (Machery Nagel), which can yield very high plasmid concentrations. 4.2.7 In Vitro Transcription (IVT) To generate antisense RNA from pGEMT- templates, plasmids were linearized using a restriction site on the opposite side of the template from the in vitro transcription promoter (either T7 or SP6). Linearization of pGEMT- plasmids for IVT was typically performed overnight at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C in the following reaction: 50 \\(\\mu\\)l pGEMT- vector containing probe template (~2.5 \\(\\mu\\)g of DNA) 3 \\(\\mu\\)l Restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs) 10 \\(\\mu\\)l 10X Restriction buffer (New England Biolabs) 37 \\(\\mu\\)l H20 Linearized plasmid was then purified by gel-extracted using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN). To perform in vitro transcription, the following reaction was allowed to proceed at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C for 3 hours: 14.5 \\(\\mu\\)l linearized DNA template (or ~2\\(\\mu\\)g of DNA) 2 \\(\\mu\\)l 10X Transcription Buffer (Roche) 2 \\(\\mu\\)l RNA Polymerase (T7 or SP6 depending on orientation of the insert) (Roche) 0.5 \\(\\mu\\)l RNAse Inhibitor, Human Placenta (New England Biolabs) 2 \\(\\mu\\)l dNTP DIG labeling mix (Roche) Following the 3 hours of incubation, the following was added to the reaction to digest DNA template: 2.5 \\(\\mu\\)l 10X DNase buffer (New England Biolabs) 2.5 \\(\\mu\\)l DNase (RNAse free) (New England Biolabs) and incubated for a further 30 minutes at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C. To precipitate the transcribed RNA, 2 \\(\\mu\\)l 0.2M EDTA (pH 8.0) 2.7 \\(\\mu\\)l 4M LiCl 75 \\(\\mu\\)l 100% ultrapure ethanol was added, briefly vortexed, and RNA was allowed to precipitate overnight at -20\\(^\\circ\\)C. The following day, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C on a tabletop centrifuge for 30 minutes. After decanting the supernatant, RNA pellet was washed with 75 \\(\\mu\\)l of 70% ethanol (Ultrapure, diluted with RNase-free H2O). Following removal of the ethanol wash, the RNA pellet was allowed to briefly airdry, before resolubilizing RNA in 20 \\(\\mu\\)l of water treated with Diethyl Pyrocarbonate (DEPC water) and 1 \\(\\mu\\)l of RNase inhibitor. After allowing pellet to disolve in DEPC water, 180 \\(\\mu\\)l of Hybmix Buffer was added (50% formamide, 5X SSC pH 7.0, 1% Boehringer block, 5mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1 mg/ml Heparin, 100 \\(\\mu\\)g/ml Yeast tRNA) and mixed thoroughly by vortexing. RNA probes were then stored at -20\\(^\\circ\\)C until needed. 4.3 Cell Culture 4.3.1 Primary Neuronal Culture Coverslip Preparation Prior to neuronal culture, circular coverslips for 24-well plates were treated by ethanol wash. For all washes coverslips were placed in a large sealed container and left to shake, first with 70% ethanol (Ultrapure EtOH diluted in ddH2O) overnight, followed by three 1-hour washes with ddH2O, followed by two 90 minute washes in 100% ethanol (Ultrapure). Finally, coverslips were washed in 70% ethanol for 15 minutes before storing in 100% Ethanol. Prior to use, ethanol was allowed to evaporate from coverslips inside the cell culture hood. To allow neuronal adhesion, coverslips were then coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma, 0.1mg/ml in ddH2O) by covering the entirety of the coverslip and incubating at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C overnight. The following morning, excess poly-L-lysine was removed, coverslips rinsed twice in ddH2O and left to dry in the cell culture hood. Isolation of Primary Cortical and Hippocampal Neurons Mouse brains of E17.5 embryos were isolated in ice-cold HBSS containing MgCl2 and CaCl2 (HBSS+/+, Gibco). Following removal of the meninges, hippocampi and cortices were dissected and processed separately. Collected tissue was washed 3 times with HBSS without MgCl2 and CaCl2 (HBSS-/-, Gibco). After the final wash, tissue was enzymatically digested at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C by resuspension in 3.5 ml HBSS-/- and 500 \\(\\mu\\)l 0.25% trypsin (Gibco). Periodically during digestion, tube was genlty flicked to facilitate dissociation. Cortical tissue was digested for ~30 minutes while hippocampal tissue required typically 15 minutes. Trypsin digestion was inactivated by addition of 2 ml of heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco). Tissue was then washed three times with 10 ml of cold HBSS+/+, before incubation with 100 \\(\\mu\\)l of 1mg/ml DNase (Worthington) for 1 minute. Tissue was then washed with 10 ml Neurobasal media (Gibco), centrifuged once at 1200 rpm for 1 minute before an additional wash with Neurobasal growth media (Neurobasal media supplemented with 1X Glutamax, 1% penicilin/streptomycin, 1X B27 (Gibco)). 2 ml of Neurobasal media was left in the tube and tissue was gently dissociated using a 10 ml pipette. Tissue was then carefully titurated 10 times using a P1000 pipette tip and then 10 times using a P200 pipette tip. Cells were then counted using a haemocytometer and plated on coated coverslips at a density of 50,000 cells per well. The day following plating neuronal media was changed to BrainPhys media containing SM1 supplement (StemCell) and cultured in this media henceforth. Nucleofection As post-mitotic neurons are infamously difficult to transfect, nucleofection, a method of in vitro electroporation, was used to introduce DNA plasmids into primary post-mitotic neurons. Following dissociation of primary neurons into a single-cell suspension, neurons were nucleofected using a Mouse neuron Nucleofector kit (VPG-1001) with an Amaxa 2b Nucleofection system (Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, this involved mixing a total amount of 1 \\(\\mu\\)g of plasmid DNA with 1 million cells in 100 \\(\\mu\\)l of provided Nucleofector solution in the nucleocuvette, followed by nucleofection using program O-005. Following nucleofection, neurons were allowed to recover immediately in 1 ml of RPMI medium for 5 minutes at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C. Neurons were then resuspended in Neurobasal growth media and plated at the appropriate density. Note: as nucleofection induces death of 40% of cells, plating density should be calculated accordingly. The day following plating neuronal media was changed to BrainPhys media containing SM1 supplement (StemCell) and cultured in this media henceforth. 4.3.2 HEK293T Culture &amp; Transfection Under normal growing conditions, HEK293T cells are cultured in DMEM+Glutamax (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicilin/streptomycin. HEK293T cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 0.3X10^6 cells per well for Co-IP, and seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells per well for IHC. Plasmid DNA was introduced into cells by chemical transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 or Turbofect (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, DNA was diluted in a volume of Opti-MEM (ThermoFisher) while transfection reagent was diluted in an equal volume of Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 minutes. Diluted DNA and diluted transfection reagent were then mixed and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes before being applied directly to cells. Cells are then harvested one day following transfection. Cells to be used for IHC are gently rinsed once in PBS and fixed for 10 minutes (1% PFA in PBS). Harvesting protein is described in the following section. 4.3.3 Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Western Blot (WB) Lysis To harvest protein from 6 well plate transfections, cells are rinsed once in PBS, then lysed on ice in 300 \\(\\mu\\)l of Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with 1X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC, Roche). Given our interest in nuclear proteins, lysates were sonicated for 15 pulses on ice using a probe sonicator. Insoluble cellular debris was then precipitated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, 4 \\(^\\circ\\)C and lysate was decanted into a new tube. Protein Concentration Protein concentration was measured using a standard Bicinchroninic acid (BCA) assay. BCA assay was carried out by diluting 10 \\(\\mu\\)l of protein sample 1:10, and plating 25 \\(\\mu\\)l onto a 96 well plate in triplicate. A Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) standard (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 \\(\\mu\\)g/\\(\\mu\\)l) was also plated. 200 \\(\\mu\\)l of working reagent (Reagent A: Reagent B = 1:50) was added to each well and allowed to incubate 20 minutes at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C in the dark. BCA assay was then measured on a nanophotometer 1374 plate reader, and protein concentration was determined by regression to the BSA standard curve. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) Prior to immunoprecipitation, each sample was adjusted to a 300 \\(\\mu\\)l volume at a protein concentration of 1.5 \\(\\mu\\)g/\\(\\mu\\)l using lysis (RIPA) buffer. The appropriate amount of lysate was also set aside for input. To perform immunoprecipitation, 1.5 \\(\\mu\\)l of the appropriate antibody was incubated per sample on a rocker for 2 hours at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. During this time, protein G sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, 25 \\(\\mu\\)l per sample) were rinsed 3 x 15 minutes in 1ml of cold TBS (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), rocking at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. Between washes beads were spun down using a short 5 second spin on a tabletop centrifuge (no greater than 9,000 rpm). Following the 2 hour antibody/lysate incubation, washed beads are added to each sample and incubated on a rocker for an additional hour at 4\\(\\circ\\)C. Following IP, beads are washed twice using lysis buffer and twice with TBS. On the final wash, as much buffer was removed as possible before addition of 25 \\(\\mu\\)l 2.5X lammeli buffer. IP was then boiled at 95\\(^\\circ\\)C for 5 minutes. For input samples, 5 \\(\\mu\\)g of total lysate was used in a volume of 25 \\(\\mu\\)l, adjusted with 5 \\(\\mu\\)l 5X lammeli buffer and the appropriate amount of lysis buffer, and boiled at 95\\(^\\circ\\)C for 5 minutes. Western Blot SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed to separate and analyse protein samples. The composition of the running gel was as follows: For two 10% Running gels (20ml): 7.78 ml ddH2O 6.6 ml 40% Acrylamide/Bisacrylamide 29:1 5.2 ml 1.5M Tris pH 9.1 0.2 ml 10% SDS 0.2 ml 10% Ammonium Persulfate (APS) 16 \\(\\mu\\)l Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) Running gel was cast, and 1 ml of isopropanol was added to the top of the gel to enable a level gel top. Following running gel polymerization, the stacking gel was prepared and added with loading combs: For two 5% stacking gels (6.1ml): 4 ml ddH2O 1.2 ml 40% Acrylamide/Bisacrylamide 29:1 800 \\(\\mu\\)l 1.0M Tris pH 6.7 92 \\(\\mu\\)l 10% SDS 48 \\(\\mu\\)l 10% Ammonium Persulfate (APS) 8 \\(\\mu\\)l Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) The internal chamber was filled with running buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) and both marker (PageRuler, Fermentas) and samples were loaded using a Hamilton microliter syringe. Protein samples were run at 60 V until clear of the stacking buffer, and then run at 120 V until finished (typically 90 minutes). Proteins were then transfered onto an Immobilon-P transfer membrane using the wet technique. Membranes were activated by briefly rinsing in methanol and then in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 20 % methanol, pH 8.3). A transfer casette was set up by stacking sponges, Whatmann paper, and Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane sandwich. Proteins were transfered for 90 minutes at 100 amps while being packed with ice to minimize resistance. Following transfer, PVDF membrane was washed three times with TBST (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) before a one hour incubation with blocking solution (3% Bovine Serum Albumin in TBST), shaking at room temperature. Primary antibodies were then applied to membranes (typically 1:1000 in TBST), shaking overnight at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. The following day, membranes were washed (3 x 15 minutes) in TBST before incubating for 2 hours with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova, 1:20,000 in TBST). Proteins were then visualized using ECL on a BioRad Transluminator using ImageLab v4.0 software. To re-image the same membrane using a different antibody, membranes were stripped with two 10 minute washes in glycine-SDS (15% glycine, 1% SDS, 10% Tween 20, pH 2.2) followed by three 10 minute washes in PBS. Membranes could then be washed in TBST and blocked for incubation with a new antibody. 4.4 In Utero Electroporation, Tissue Processing and Histology 4.4.1 In Utero Electroporation (IUE) In Utero Electroporation was performed according to the initial protocol (Saito 2006) with minor modifications and is described here. All surgical procedures were performed in accordance with LaGeSo experimental licenses G0079/11 and G0206/16. Animal surgery was performed in a sterile asceptic environment and all instruments were sterilized using 70% ethanol and a Germinator 500 glass bead sterilizer. Prior to surgery, in utero electroporation buffer (IUE buffer; 1 X PBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1% penicilin/streptomycin) was warmed to 37\\(^\\circ\\)C. Glass capillaries were pulled using a HEK-PIP6 capillary puller and filled with a mixture of 30 \\(\\mu\\)l of endotoxin-free plasmid DNA (~2\\(\\mu\\)g/\\(\\mu\\)l) and 1.5 \\(\\mu\\)l filter-sterilized FastGreen. Induction of anesthesia and maintenence of anesthesia was mediated by a supply of isoflurane (set at 2.5 flow) mixed with medical air supplied at 1 atmosphere of pressure. Following induction of anesthesia in a sealed chamber, pregnant females were transfered to a heating pad where continuous isoflurane was supplied via a fitted nose cone. Bepanthen was applied to the eyes to prevent corneal desiccation during surgery, and 150 \\(\\mu\\)l of analgesic (Buprenorphine 300 \\(\\mu\\)g/ml, Buscopan 30 \\(\\mu\\)g/ml) was injected subcutaneously as analgesic. Once under stable anesthesia, determined by the pinch test, the abdomen of the mouse was disinfected using iodine spray and wiped clean with 70% ethanol. A midline incision, around 3 cm in length was made in the skin of the abdomen. After freeing adjacent connective fibres, the incision was repeated on the muscle wall of the abdomen, exposing the uterine horns. Embryos were then carefully pulled out of the abdominal cavity using blunt forceps. Periodically during the surgery, embryos were bathed in IUE buffer using a pasteur pipette. To perform the electroporation the embryo was held gently using the operators fingers, and the tip of the capillary containing the plasmid DNA was inserted into the embryo’s lateral ventricle near the brain midline. DNA was then pushed into the ventricle using a picopump, controlled by a foot pedal. After sufficient pulses (visible by the FastGreen turning the ventricle dark green), platinum electrodes were placed around the head of the embryo (+ve electrode to the injection site) to apply an electric pulse using a BTX electroporator. An electroporation program of six 35 mV wave pulses, each 50 ms long, with a 950 ms interval, was applied. Once all accessible embryos are electroporated, the abdominal wall was stitched with thread, and the skin was stapled using wound-clip staples (Autoclip). Following the surgery the animal was returned to her clean home cage to recover. Post-operative drinking water was changed to contain a final concentration of 25 \\(\\mu\\)g/ml Tramadol and 12 \\(\\mu\\)g/ml Buscopan for 2 days to prevent abdominal cramps. 4.4.2 Tissue Fixation and Perfusion For embryonic tissue, the date of vaginal plug was counted as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Pregnant females at the desired stage were killed by a lethal dose of Avertin or Pentobarbital and death was confirmed via cervical dislocation. Following a midline incision, uterine horns were excised and placed in a dish containing ice-cold PBS where embryonic brains were isolated using microforceps. Brains were then immediately fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA, 4 % in PBS) overnight at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. Embryos younger than E16 it is preferrable to fix no longer than 4 hours. For animals older than P6, animals were given a lethal injection of pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with first PBS (10-20ml, depending on age) until the liver was clear, followed by perfusion with 4% PFA (5-20ml, depending on age). The head was then decapitated, skull carefully removed, and brain fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. If brains were not to be processed immediately, they were transfered to PBS containing 0.001% sodium azide. 4.4.3 Cryosectioning If brains were to be used for in situ hybridization, all solutions were based using ddH2O treated with Diethyl pyrocarbonate (Sigma, prepare by shaking 1 ml DEPC in 1 L ddH2O at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C o/n) and cryosections are the weapon of choice. For the best results cryopreservation should occur immediately after fixation without delay. Following fixation, brains were briefly rinsed 5 minutes in PBS prior to transfering to 15 % sucrose (in DEPC-PBS). Brains are allowed to dehydrate in 15% sucrose for 3 hours or until they sink to the bottom of the well. Brains were then moved to 30% sucrose (in DEPC-PBS) and incubated a minimum of 6 hours, but typically left overnight. Following sucrose dehydration, cerebellum of brains was removed using a razerblade and briefly swilled in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT, Tissue-Tek). Brains were then embedded, brainstem down, on in tissue blocks filled with OCT. Tissue blocks were then snap frozen by placing on a brick of dry ice until frozen. Tissue blocks were then stored at -20\\(^\\circ\\)C until sectioning. Blocks that require longer term storage were placed at -80\\(^\\circ\\)C. Cryoblocks were manually sectioned with a thickness of 14 \\(\\mu\\)m on a cryostat at -20\\(^\\circ\\)C and collected on positively charged slides (Superfrost, ThermoFisher). Slides with sections were allowed to air dry for 2 hours before being stored at -20\\(^\\circ\\)C. Alternatively, cryoblocks were thrown in the air, and cut latterally with a katana. This yielded random sized sections, but when you are aiming at a mouse brain in the air you get what you get. 4.4.4 Immuno Histochemistry (IHC) IHC was performed on either cryosections or paraffin sections. For paraffin sections, an antigen retrieval step (Boiling 3 x 5 minutes in Antigen Unmasking Solution, Vector Labs) was performed prior to blocking. Immunohistochemistry was primarily performed on cryosections. Prior to IHC, paraffin slides are rehydrated as in 4.4.8 and an antigen retrieval step was performed were the sections were boiled in a citrate buffer (Vectorlabs antigen unmasking solution, 3 boils 5 minutes each). Henceforth the protocol for immunohistochemical staining of paraffin or cyrosections is identical. To perform IHC, slides were washed 2 x 5 minutes in PBS, and then blocked and permeabilized in blocking solution (2% BSA, 1% Triton X100 in PBS), where slides are covered with a thin piece of parafilm to inhibit dessication. All antibody steps use this same blocking solution as diluent. Primary antibodies were then diluted (typically ~1:200-500) in blocking solution and incubated on the sections at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C overnight. The following day, slides were washed 3 x 10 minutes in PBS to remove excess antibody. Sections were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (ie Donkey anti-Rabbit, Donkey anti-rat etc. (Dianova)) diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer for 2 hours at room temperature. If Draq5 far-red nuclear stain was to be used, it was included in the secondary antibody incubation step. Following secondary antibody incubation, slides are rinsed 2 X 5 minutes in PBS, and stained with Hoechst/DAPI (1:5000 in PBS) for 5 minutes at room temperature. When using adult sections, lipofuscin autofluorescence was quenched by a 10 minute incubation with a solution containing 10mM CuS04 &amp; 50mM NH4Cl. Sections were then mounted aqueously using Immu-Mount (Shandon).

First, images to be quantified were masked such that only the dentate gyrus was visible, then split into individual files for RGB. Upon file import into cellprofiler, metadata from split-RGB files, each containing DAPI (blue), ki-67 (green) and Prox1 (red). Metadata extraction of each was done by the regular expression: ^(?P&lt;Genotype&gt;[A-Z,a-z]{2,3})_ (?P&lt;animal&gt;[a-z]{2,3}[0-9]{3})_(?P&lt;Slide&gt;.*)_(?P&lt;Channel&gt;.).tif Primary objects were identified for each channel using the following parameters: For nuclei, min-diameter 8, max-diameter 14, threshold correction 1.5, distinguishing by shape. For ki67, min-diameter 5, max-diameter 25, threshold correction 1, distinguishing by intensity. Prox1 primary objects were identified using the same settings as nuclei. Primary objects were then related to nuclei, removing false signal, and count was exported to a csv file for analysis in R. To calculate cells/\\(\\mu\\)m, the area of the dentate gyrus measured was quantified manually in imageJ (Schindelin et al. (2012), https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ). 4.4.6 In Situ Hybridization (ISH) In situ hybridization was carried out largely in line with the protocol outlined in (Bormuth et al. 2013) and is summarized here. Prior to beginning the protocol, forceps used to handle slides were washed for 30 minutes in 3% H2O2 and glass cuvettes were baked at 200\\(^\\circ\\)C for two hours. All buffers used prior to the hybridization step were made using DEPC-ddH2O and autoclaved. Gloves are worn throughout the protocol and all washing steps include gentle shaking unless specified otherwise. Day 1 Cryosections were allowed to thaw and air dry at room temperature for 20 minutes prior to beginning the protocol. During this time the sections were labelled with a pencil with the RNA probe to be applied to that section. Sections were fixed for 5 minutes (4% PFA in PBS) at room temperature without shaking. After this step PFA is saved for post-fixation step after proteinase K digestion. Following fixation, slides were washed 2 x 5 minutes with DEPC-PBS. During this time proteinase K buffer (30mM Tris, 10mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS pH 8.0) was pre-warmed to 37\\(^\\circ\\)C. Slides were washed once in proteinase K buffer, and then incubated with proteinase K buffer containing 20\\(\\mu\\)g/ml proteinase K at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C for exactly 2 minutes. Proteinase K digestion needs to be a tightly controlled incubation, as too long will result in overdigested tissue. (If performing a combination ISH/IHC, substitute the proteinase K step with a single wash of 5X SSC pH 7.0). Proteinase K digestion was inactivated by immediate washing in 0.2% Glycine in DEPC-PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. Slides were then washed 2 x 5 minutes in PBS prior to post-fixation. Post-fixation was carried out by adding glutaraldehyde (final concentration 0.2%) to the previously used 4% PFA in DEPC-PBS, and incubating for 20 minutes at RT. Slides were then washed twice in DEPC-PBS before pre-hybridization. Pre-hybridization was carried out by applying 200 \\(\\mu\\)l hybmix buffer to each slide and covering with parafilm, sealing in a humid chamber (50% FA 50% ddH2O) and incubating at the same temperature to be used for the hybridization (typically 68\\(^\\circ\\)C) for 2 hours. Towards the end of the pre-hybridization incubation, RNA probes are diluted in hybmix (10-16 \\(\\mu\\)l of probe per 150 \\(\\mu\\)l hybmix) and denatured at 65\\(^\\circ\\)C for 5 minutes. RNA probes are then kept on ice until being applied to slides. RNA probes are then applied to slides, covered with parafilm, sealed and incubated at 68\\(^\\circ\\)C overnight. Day 2 The next day, probe solution was discarded and slides are rinsed in 2X SSC pH 4.5 for 5 minutes at RT. Slides were then pre-washed in warmed RNase buffer (15 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH) for 5 minutes. To remove background by digesting un-hybridized RNA, slides were then treated with RNase (20 \\(^\\mu\\)g/ml) in RNase buffer at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C for 30 minutes. After RNase treatment, slides were washed with 2X SSC, formamide washes and KTBT (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1% Triton X-100) in the following fashion: 2X SSC pH 4.5: 5 minutes, RT (2X SSC, 50% formamide): 30 minutes, 65\\(^\\circ\\)C (2X SSC, 50% formamide): 30 minutes, 65\\(^\\circ\\)C (2X SSC, 50% formamide): 30 minutes, 65\\(^\\circ\\)C KTBT: 10 minutes, RT KTBT: 10 minutes, RT KTBT: 10 minutes, RT Slides were then incubated in ISH blocking solution (20% sheep serum in KTBT) for 2 hours at room temperature. Following blocking, slides were incubated with anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase antibody (Roche, 1:1000 in ISH blocking solution) overnight at 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. If perfoming a combination IHC/ISH, additional primary antibodies were included at this time. Day 3 On the final day, sections were washed with KTBT and NT(M)T (100 mM Tris pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Tween-20) in the following fashion: KTBT: 5 minutes, RT KTBT: 5 minutes, RT KTBT: 5 minutes, RT KTBT: 30 minutes, RT KTBT: 30 minutes, RT KTBT: 30 minutes, RT (If performing a combination IHC/ISH, slides were incubated here with secondary antibodies in KTBT.) NT(M)T: 5 minutes, RT NT(M)T: 5 minutes, RT NT(M)T: 5 minutes, RT After the third NT(M)T wash, slides were developed until stained by the addition of NBT/BCIP substrate (Roche, 1:50 in NT(M)T) or in the case of IHC/ISH, liquid FastRed (Abcam, ab64254). Slides were then washed ad libitum in PBST (1% Triton X-100 in PBS) to clear excess background staining. For fluorescent IHC/ISH slides, sections were washed once in PBS and mounted using Immu-Mount. For normal in situ, slides are then fixed for 5 minutes in 4% PFA in PBS before dehydration by ethanol row and non-aqueous mounting using Entellan (Merck). 4.4.7 Paraffin Sectioning Following fixation, brains were washed (3 x 15 minutes) with PBS and transfered to paraffin cassettes and dehydrated through increasing ethanol concentrations while shaking: 30% Ethanol: 2 hours 50% Ethanol: 2 hours 70% Ethanol: Overnight 80% Ethanol: 2 hours 90% Ethanol: 2 hours 100% Ethanol: 1 hour Xylol I: 2 hours Xylol II: 1 hour Following Xylol II, paraffin cassettes were incubated in paraplast I at 60\\(^\\circ\\)C overnight, followed by a second incubation in paraplast II for 3 hours. Brains were then cast in paraffin in metal embedding molds and allowed to solidify on the 4\\(^\\circ\\)C surface for 1 hour. For sectioning, a Microtome (Leica) was used, and 14 \\(\\mu\\)m thick sections collected in 37\\(^\\circ\\)C ddH2O. Sections were collected on positively charged slides (Superfrost, ThermoFisher). Following sectioning, slides were incubated overnight at 37\\(^\\circ\\)C. 4.4.8 Nissl Stain Cresyl Violet acetate was used to perform the Nissl stain. To make the cresyl violet staining solution, 0.1 g of cresul violet acetate was disolved in 100 ml ddH2O, covering with parafilm and stirring overnight at room temperature. The following morning, 10 drops (~0.3ml) of glacial acetic acid was added, stirring 5-10 additional minutes. The cresyl violet staining solution was then filtered to remove any precipitate and stored in a light-protective bottle at room temperature. Prior to any staining, the cresyl violet staining solution was filtered again. Nissl staining was performed on rehydrated parrafin sections. The following series was used to rehydrate parrafin sections: Xylol II: 5 minutes Xylol I: 5 minutes 100% Ethanol: 3 minutes 100% Ethanol: 3 minutes 95% Ethanol: 5 minutes Sections were immediately stained in 0.1% Cresyl Violet for 3-10 minutes. Staining with pre-warmed (37-50\\(^\\circ\\)C) Cresyl violet can vastly improve penetration and enhance staining). Sections were then rinsed quickyl in distilled water, removing excess cresyl violet. Stain is then differentiated in 95% ethanol for 2-30 minutes, checking microscopically for optimal staining. Sections were then dehydrated by two 5 minute washes in 100% ethanol, and cleared in Xylol (2 x 5 minutes) before mounting with entellan (Sigma). 4.4.9 Golgi Impregnation and Dendritic Complexity Analysis Fresh brain samples from WT, HP1\\(\\beta\\)f/fEmx1Cre, HP1\\(\\gamma\\)f/fEmx1Cre and HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\)f/fEmx1Cre of young and aged mice were cut into two hemispheres and impregnated in Golgi-Cox solution for 2 weeks as described in (Zaqout and Kaindl 2016). Sholl analysis (Sholl 1953) was performed on CA3 hippocampal neurons to assess the dendritic complexity for both apical and basal dendrites. Concentric circles and cell counter plug-ins available for ImageJ were used to quantify the total intersections number of the dendritic tree with 30 10-\\(\\mu\\)m spaced concentric circles. Simple neurite tracer plug-in available for Fiji/ImageJ was used to draw representative neurons. 4.5 Behavioral Experiments All behavioral experiments were undertaken with the support of the Animal Outcome Core Facility (AOCF) in house at the Charité Cross Over building (CCO). Behavioral tests were performed within the guidelines granted by the Landesamt für Gedundheit und Soziales Berlin (LaGeSo) under an extension to experimental license G0079/11 and G0206/16. Prior to behavioral testing, male HP1FEC mice were implanted with subdermal RFID transponders to ensure accurate identification. Behavioral experiments were performed at two different time points. The ‘Young’ time point (2.5 - 3 Months) and the ‘Aged’ time point (13-14 Months). Prior to each cohort of behavioral testing, all animals were subjected to a modified SmithKline Beecham, Harwell, Imperial College, Royal London Hospital, phenotype assessment (SHIRPA), which ensured animals did not have any gross deficits in vision, audition, grip strength, pina reflex and normal exploratory locomotion. Following SHIRPA assessment on animals in any given cohort, behavioral tests were always carried out at the same time of day, with tests occurring in the following order: Open Field activity Pre-Pulse Inhibition Context-Cued Fear Conditioning Barnes Maze Social Activity Monitor (SAM) HomeCageScan Next Construction 4.5.1 Open Field Activity The open field test is a common test of general activity and exploratory behavior. While movement is the primary metric, this can be influenced by motor output, exploratory drive, circadian cycle, and freezing or fear-related behaviors. The Open Field test was performed largely according to reccomendations by (D. Gould 2009). To conduct the Open Field Test, animals were placed in the centre of a square enclosure while an overhead camera tracks movement for 10 minutes using the Biobserve Viewer Software. Following a single trial, feces and urine was quantified and the box rigourously cleaned with 5% ethanol. Activity in the ‘centre zone’ and activity in the periphery was binned per minute and exported for later analysis in R. 4.5.2 Paired-Pulse Inhibition Many organisms display an innate reflexive reaction to an intense unexpected acoustic stimulus, which is typically termed the ‘acoustic startle response’ or ‘startle reflex’. In rodents this is manifested as a rapid muscle contraction resembling a ‘flinch-like’ action. A test for paired-pulse inhibition involves measuring how a weaker pre-stimulus (pre-pulse) diminishes the reaction to the intense stimulus (startle pulse). The normal response is that larger and larger pre-pulses result in smaller startle responses. This reduction in amplitude of startle response reflects temporary adaptations afforded by the nervous system. Deficits of pre-pulse inhibition are thought to be linked to abnormalities of sensorimotor gating. Abrogations in PPI are most commonly observed in schizophrenia (Braff, Geyer, and Swerdlow 2001), but have also been observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s (Zoetmulder et al. 2014) and Alzheimer’s disease (Ueki et al. 2006). Paired-pulse inhibition was measured two animals at a time in a 2-box startle box apparatus (TSE Systems), which consisted of black soundproofed plexiglass boxes (49cm x 49cm x 49cm). Metal bars on the floors of internal cages allow for precise measurement of startle response via built-in pressure sensors. Background noise was set at 65dB. Upon program start, animals acclimatized for 5 minutes, followed by a program that randomized by trial induction of a startle pulse alone (120dB, for 40ms), or the startle pulse that had been preceded by a pre-pulse (either 69dB, 73dB or 81dB for 20ms). Following testing data was exported for later analysis in R. 4.5.3 Context-Cued Fear Conditioning To measure context and cue dependent memory, mice were analysed two at a time in two adjacent multi-conditioning boxes from TSE Systems. The fear learning boxes are designed to be sound-proofed and have a sound probe, camera, and an context arena with metal-grated floor and walls high enough to contain the animal. Context cued fear learning is tested over 5 phases: Phase 1 (Shock): Animals are allowed to acclimatize in the chamber for 4 minutes (Context), which is followed by a 30 second sound (Cue), which is immediately followed by a 2 second weak electric shock on the floor of the context arena. Phase 2 (Context 24h): The following day (24h later), the animals are placed back into the context arena and freezing behavior was recorded for 3 minutes. Phase 3 (Cue 24h): Two hours following the Context 24h test, a cover is placed over the metal floor of the context arena and animals are put back under observation. Following a 3 minute habituation, the cue sound is played for 3 minutes and freezing behavior is recorded. Phase 4 (Context 7 Days): Exactly as in phase 2, context is tested 7 days following phase 1. Phase 5 (Cue 7 Days): Two hours following the Context 7 day test, animals are tested for cue, exactly as done in phase 3. Following completion of the Fear Learning paradigm, automated freezes and freeze intervals measured by TSE System software was cross-referenced with the obtained videos. Freezes measured by the software with duration smaller than 2 seconds were removed and data was plotted in R. 4.5.4 Barnes Maze Similar to the Morris Water Maze, the Barnes Maze evaluates visual-spatial learning and memory in rodents (Barnes 1979). This is corroborated by many studies where rodents with hippocampal damage show markedly impaired performance in the test (Deacon and Rawlins 2002; Fox et al. 1998; Harrison et al. 2006). It carries advantages over the Morris Water Maze in that no strong aversive stimuli or deprivation is utilized, rather a weak averzive stimulus (bright light, sound and open area) is utilized. It is also a lot cleaner. In our case, Barnes Maze was performed with short-term and long-term reference memory in mind (Sunyer et al. 2007). Both training and testing of the Barnes maze was recorded using Biobserve Viewer software with the Barnes maze plugin. The Barnes maze consists of a circular platform that contains 20 holes around the circumference of the platform. Only one hole contains a submerged nest to serve as an escape from the open environment. To perform the Barnes Maze test, animals are trained on the location of the submerged test for the first 4 days. This involves similar conditions to the test paradigm, where the mouse is placed in the centre of the platform and loud static noise is played. Mice were trained to find the hidden nest (target hole) over four 3-minute trials over 4 training days. Once the mouse finds the hole the loud static noise is immediately discontinued. If the mouse does not find the nest by the end of the 3 minute trial, it is shown the hole by the experimenter. Once the mouse is in the nest it is allowed to remain there for 30 seconds to allow positive reinforcement. Following 4 days of training, the 5th day involves the 24h test, where mice are placed in the centre of the platform and their hole seeking behavior is recorded in terms of time to the target hole, primary errors (errors before target hole), and the number of head pokes in each hole. 4.5.5 Social Activity Monitor (SAM) To measure basic interaction and circadian activity, animals in their home cages were placed on top of RF sensors that detect motion where animal activity was recorded for 14 days using Phenosoft control software. SAM data was binned by hour and following data export, RFIDs were decoded to corresponding animal ids and genotypes. 4.5.6 Micro Behaviors (HomeCageScan) To examine any changes in stereotyped murine behavior, mice were recorded individually over 24hrs using CleverSys software. Prior to recording, background cage registration, night/day and transition calibrations were set according to each cage. For data export, data was binned by minute and by hour. Individual animal data was then combined into one large dataframe for analysis in R. 4.5.7 Nest Construction A behavior exhibited solely by male mice is their innate desire to construct nests. This behaviour can be easily pertubed by distress, pain and cognitive distruptions (Deacon 2012). To test nest construction ability, mice were housed individually and given a square piece of densely woven cotton called a ‘nestlet’ (Ancare). The first 24hrs (Habituation) allowed the animal to become familiar with the piece of cotton as a nesting material. Prior to the second 24hrs (Nest Construction Test), the cotton was removed and replaced with a new cotton square, which was weighed prior to adding it to the cage. The following morning, what remained of the cotton square was weighed, and the complexity of the nest was given a score of 1-5 based on criteria from (Deacon 2012): The Nestlet is largely untouched (&gt;90% intact). The Nestlet is partially torn up (50-90% remaining intact). The Nestlet is mostly shredded but often there is no identifiable nest site: &lt; 50% of the Nestlet remains intact but &lt; 90% is within a quarter of the cage floor area, i.e. the cotton is not gathered into a nest but spread around the cage. Note: the material may sometimes be in a broadly defined nest area but the critical definition is that 50-90% has been shredded. An identifiable, but flat nest: &gt; 90% of the Nestlet is torn up, the material is gathered into a nest within a quarter of the cage floor area, but the nest is flat, with walls higher than mouse body height (curled up on its side) on less than 50% of its circumference. A (near) perfect nest: &gt; 90% of the Nestlet is torn up, the nest is a crater, with walls higher than mouse body height on more than 50% of its circumference 4.6 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Volumetrics MRI was performed at a 7 Tesla rodent scanner (Pharmascan 70 ⁄ 16, Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) with a 20mm - 1H-RF quadratur-volume resonator. For imaging the mouse brain a T2-weighted 2D turbo spin-echo sequence was used (imaging parameters TR / TE = 5505 / 36 ms, rare factor 8, 6 averages, 46 axial slices with a slice thickness of 0.350 mm, field of view of 2.56 x 2.56 cm, matrix size 256 x 256; scan time 13m12s). With an in-house developed MATLAB toolbox MRI data were registered on the Allen mouse brain atlas (ABA). The volumes of each single ABA brain structure were calculated fully automated followed by label based statistics for defined regions (Koch et al. 2017). For section-wise analysis, the mean isocortex volume per section per genotype per age was calculated and tested using two-way ANOVA. 4.7 Reduced Read Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBSeq) RRBS-seq was carried out following a previously described method (Boyle et al. 2012) with minor modifications. 500 ng of genomic DNA was used as a starting material. Bisulfite conversion was done by the EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit (Zymo Research, #D5005) with 50 ng of DNA, per sample. 2x KAPA HiFi Hot Start Uracil+ Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems, #KK2801) was utilized for library amplification. PCR amplification was done for 10 cycles. References "],

HP1\\(\\beta\\)/\\(\\gamma\\) DKO animals related to Anti-viral signalling or interferon response (88). The majority of differentially regulated HP1DKO genes that overlap with those on the interferome database (55) were identified from overlap with a previously published dataset where cortical neurons were stimulated with interferon-\\(\\beta\\) ( IFN\\(\\beta\\) ) and their transcriptome analyzed. 5.2.3 Genomic Hotspots Sensitive to HP1 Deficiency in the Hippocampus Figure 5.5: Karyotype of Genic Loci Sensitive to HP1 Deficiency. (A): Coding and non-coding loci (ERVs omitted) that are changed in the hippocampus following deficiency of HP1\\(\\beta\\) and HP1\\(\\gamma\\) identified in this study. Activated areas are coloured red while areas underrepresented (likely due to dentate gyrus malformation) are coloured blue. (B) Liftover of mouse loci identified in this study to the human genome.

Larger pipelines utilized the Snakemake pipeline building system (Such as TETranscripts and deeptools) Pre-built self-contained pipeline was customized for running on CUBI (Such as the LIONS chimeric analysis) All work on CUBI was done using screen/ssh, and data was transfered to and from the cluster using rsync. 6.1 Software Environment Management Prior to running any jobs on the CUBI cluster, software dependencies were managed using a miniconda environment. For example, if a particular pipeline required python 2.7, and samtools0.18, an environment containing these dependencies with the name ‘py2’ could be created conda create -n py2 python=2.7 samtools=0.18 and later sourced source activate py2 prior to running any pipelines using the py2 software environment. 6.2 Snakemake Jobs To run large batch jobs on the CUBI cluster, pipelines were written in Snakemake https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ , which serves as python wrapper for bash scripts. For parallel distribution of jobs on the cluster using qsub, a bash script such as submit_snakejob.sh was written, which includes all the relevant qsub flags which specify requested CPU per job and memory requirements. submit_snakejob.sh: #!/bin/bash #$ -V #$ -j y #$ -o logs #$ -r yes #$ -cwd #$ -S /bin/bash #$ -P control export TMPDIR=/fast/users/newmana_c/scratch/tmp export LOGDIR=logs/${JOB_ID} mkdir -p $LOGDIR set -x snakemake \\ --drmaa &quot; \\ -V \\ -cwd \\ -P medium \\ -l h_vmem=8g \\ -l h_rt=72:00:00 \\ -pe smp 8 \\ -j yes \\ -m e \\ -M andrew.newman@charite.de \\ -o $LOGDIR/&quot; \\ -j 2 \\ -k \\ -p Calling Snakemake from the shell script directs to the Snakefile, where the pipeline is specified. Snakemake uses the snakefile to look for rules used to create the desired outputs from the firs rule. For this reason rule all is placed first, and snakemake works to find the inputs for this rule. In this way the pipeline is built backwards based on what outputs are desired and what wildcards are specified. 6.3 TETranscripts Pipeline To run the TETranscripts pipeline, a conda environment containing python 3.5, STAR, samtools and TEtranscripts was sourced. The following Snakefile was written using the aid of some existing templates (such as https://github.com/leipzig/snakemake-example/blob/master/Snakefile) in order to run TETranscripts on all HP1 paired end RNAseq data.

The metadata file coldata.txt was then prepared where each row in it corresponds to each column of expression data in counts.clean.tab. In this way lane and batch effects can easily be observed in addition to easy grouping by age and genotype.

Following the first genome-wide plot, the upper 50 percent (rule subsample) of the comatrix was subset and re-plot yielding _top50 plots. Sample and annotation wildcards were specified using a config.yaml file. config.yaml: --- samples: WT_young_2: bams/WT_young_2.bam WT_old_2: bams/WT_old_2.bam BKO_young_2: bams/BKO_young_2.bam BKO_old_2: bams/BKO_old_2.bam gKO_young_2: bams/gKO_young_2.bam gKO_old_2: bams/gKO_old_2.bam DKO_young_2: bams/DKO_young_2.bam DKO_old_2: bams/DKO_old_2.bam annotations: LINE: annotations/mm10.LINE.bed SINE: annotations/mm10.SINE.bed LTR: annotations/mm10.LTR.bed The Deeptools pipeline was run according to the follwoing Snakefile: #! bin/env/python # deeptools Pipeline # Invoked by submit_cov.sh in ~/scratch/deeptools/HP1/ shell.prefix(&quot;set -eo pipefail;

For the human genome, gene locations were converted from mouse GRCm38.p5 assembly to Human GRCh38.p12 using the UCSC’s batch liftover tool https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver. Bed files containing differentially expressed genes were then used to annotate mouse and human genomes using NCBI’s ‘genome annotation page’: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/gdp/ . 6.8 About this Thesis This thesis was written in R markdown using a customized version of the bookdown package (https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) in RStudio.
